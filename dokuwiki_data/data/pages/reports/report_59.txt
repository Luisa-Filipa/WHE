==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 59

**Building Type:** Reinforced concrete frame with concrete shear walls - dual system

**Country:** SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC

**Author(s):** Adel Awad, Hwaija Bassam, Isreb Talal

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the main cities of Syria like Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Homs, and Hama. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** These buildings are characterized by a combination of shear walls and frames in both directions. The buildings are multiple housing units found in the main cities of Syria. The shear walls are often part of the elevator and service cores, whereas the frames are arranged in-plane, in conjunction with the walls, to support the floor system. Stiffness and mass distribution are irregular and the majority of buildings may experience soft-story or torsional problems. As a result, these buildings are expected to have only moderate seismic resistance.

**Length of time practiced:** Less than 25 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 20-49 units

**Typical number of stories:** 6-15

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** Typically

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 30

**Typical plan width (meters):** 20

**Typical story height (meters):** 3.1

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Dual system Frame with shear wall

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical and lateral load-resisting system is a dual system. Shear walls and frames (columns, beams) carry gravity loading. We can assume that the shear walls provide adequate strength and stiffness to control lateral displacements.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 3-4%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 3-4%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 3 %. The ratio between total wall area/plan area is 1 to 3% (for each floor).

**Wall Openings:** Area of openings/walls surface area= 20% for inner walls and 40% for outer walls.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** Buildings of this type haven't a lot of modifications yet.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footingShallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation

**Additional comments on foundation:**
