**Building Type:** Typical Single-Story Residential Construction Practices in Trinidad and Tobago

**Country:** Trinidad and Tobago

**Author(s):** Richard P. Clarke, Rakesh Ramnath

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural, sub-urban and urban areas.This form of construction is to be found in about 70% of all of the residential construction (i.e. isolated houses, apartment buildings, condominiums, townhouses).

**Summary:** Typical single-story residential construction in Trinidad and Tobago comprises 100 mm thickunreinforced clay tile or concrete block masonry (URM) load-bearing walls supporting the roof. The roofing is a 20 to 30 degree gable or hipped shape and is of approximately 0.2 to 0.5 kN/m2 in weight. It comprises galvanized steel sheets supported by timber laths or coldformed steel Z-purlins, in turn supported by timber or structural steel rafters. The rafters are nailed or bolted to the top of the walls, without blocking between the rafters. The flexible roof cannot act as a diaphragm. The soil class ranges from IBC classes B to E. Given the significant seismic hazard for Trinidad and Tobago, (i.e. rock PGA in the range of 0.2g to 0.6g for 10% exceedance probability in 50 years), this form of residential construction is quite vulnerable.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 1

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** Typically

**Comments:** This type of construction has become prevalent because it is the least costly.The main function of this building typology is sin

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** A typical residential structure is rectangular and 8.6 m wide x 11.0 m long, in plan. The floor height is typically 2.4 m.The walls on the perimeter of the roof support the roof, though sometimes an interior wall can be used as well. Thesame type of URM wall is used for the internal partitions and are connected to other walls by 'toothing'.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 7-14

**Typical plan width (meters):** 6-10

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.4

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in lime/cement mortar

**Additional comments on structural system:** Gravity Load-Resisting SystemThe vertical load-resisting system is un-reinforced masonry walls. The load-bearing walls are under combined axialload and out-of-plane bending. Since they are supported at the base on a simple mortar bed, and given the simpleconnection to the roof rafters at the top, the walls are 'pinned' at their base and at the top of the walls.Lateral Load-Resisting SystemThe lateral load-resisting system is un-reinforced masonry walls. Under lateral load the walls cannot be considered asflanged in -plan since the vertical connections between walls at their corners are inadequate for structural integrity.Given the low roof weight and wall weight, and their squat aspect ratio, the walls will act as shear walls resisting inplanesliding loads at the base joint and out-of-plane toppling loads. There is a RC beam at the top of the walls thatact as a "ring beam" enabling a degree of interaction among orthogonal walls.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** It is not "brick" that is used, but rather either clay tiles, which have horizontal cells, or concrete hollow blocks, whichhave vertical cells.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 3-4%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 3-4%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural walldensity is up to 3 %. There is limited scope for variation since the amount of structural wall area is determined by theroof support requirements.Wall proportions are up to 25% for unreinforced masonry wall.

**Wall Openings:** 

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** The most common type of modification is to add along one or both sides of the house for additional bedrooms,expansion of the kitchen or living room, or for a carport.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** It consists of cast in-place reinforced concrete piers. Wall footings are used when the soil is firm. They are typically0.6m wide and 0.3m deep with 3 No. 12mm high tensile steel longitudinal rebars, and 10mm mild steel transverserebar at 250mm center-to-center spacing. Cast-in-place piers are used when the soil is soft. The tie-beams are typically0.3m wide and 0.4m deep with 3 No. 12mm high tensile steel longitudinal rebars top and bottom, and 10mm mildsteel transverse rebar at 200mm center-to-center spacing. The piles are typically spaced 3.0m apart along wall lines andare 300mm in diameter and 4.0m deep with 4 No. 16mm high tensile steel longitudinal rebar, and 10mm mild steeltransverse rebar at 200mm center-to-center spacing. For both types of foundation, the concrete typically has a 28-daycompressive strength of 21 MPa (3000 psi). The regions between the tie beams are comprised of slab-on-gradeconcrete construction as described previously for the case of shallow foundations.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** The floor is a 100mm thick slab-on-grade and the reinforcement is steel fabric of 142 mm2/m.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** The roofing iscomprised of galvanized steel sheets supported by timber laths or cold-formed steel Z-purlins, in turn supported bytimber or structural steel beams or rafters.

**Additional comments section 2:** On sloping land it is common practice to cut or fill and use retaining walls When separated from adjacentbuildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 5.0 meters.

==== 4. Socio-Economic Issues ====

**Patterns of occupancy:** Each building typically has 1 housing unit(s). A typical household comprises of the "extended" family in which case, inaddition to the parents and children, there are also grandparents, aunts, uncles, some of their children, and friends. Inmany instances there is only one parent. The retirees or unemployed usually come and go. The former assist with obtaining supplies, and the latter seek workor odd jobs.

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** The durations for the earthquakes were short (<6 sec). Damage was mainly as repairable horizontal or diagonalcracking to piers. In south Tobago in the 1997 event there was considerable liquefaction failure. There were about 3events of magnitude > 5.5 from 1997 to the present of (MMI) V to VI. Data is available from the Seismic ResearchCenter of The University of the West Indies.
