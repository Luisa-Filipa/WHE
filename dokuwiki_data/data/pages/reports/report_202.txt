==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 202

**Building Type:** PC Frame Buildings (Series 1-451)

**Country:** Armenia

**Author(s):** 

**Last Updated:**

**Regions Where Found:** This building typology can be found in all big cities in Armenia. Roughly estimated, around 15% of the multi-apartment building stock of the country consist of this typology.

**Summary:** Stone buildings, Mydis-type walls of cement mortar and crushed stones are standard with thicknesses of 50 cm. Stone masonry type with clear joints is rarely used where located at inner court that cannot be seen from the main roads. Pre-cast concrete void slabs. Seismic bands are provided around the floor slabs.Usually for 3 to 5-storey multi-apartment buildings, constructed between 1958 and 1970. Generally used for construction in seismic regions of intensity 7-8.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 20-49 unitsResidential, 50+ units

**Typical number of stories:** 3-5

**Terrain-Flat:** Off

**Terrain-Sloped:** Off

**Comments:** Construction type typically on both flat and sloped (hilly) terrains.

=== Building Codes and Standards===

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** Engineers are involved in the design process; the construction is carried out by builders.All buildings were constructed according to SNIP 62 used for all countries in the Soviet Union. Some modifications had been made in 1984 and 1994. The current standards are the Seismic Code of the Republic of Armenia CHPA II-2.02-94.

=== Construction Economics ===

**Unit construction cost:** Generally, code provisions were followed in the construction process. Construction is typically formal (with permits, plans, etc) and authorized as per development control rules.The owner, if interested, is the one who maintains the building.Total construction cost between 840-3300 thousand Soviet Rubles (as of 1959).

=== Past Earthquakes ===


**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** The 1988 Earthquake with epicenter in Spitak, Armenia (Mw 6.9) affected buildings of this construction typology.The lack of unification between the seismic bands and the floor void slabs, as well as the floor void slabs supported by longitudinal walls, caused larger damages such as out-of-plane failures of stone-bearing walls located at the side of the buildings.

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

^Structural/Architectural Feature ^ Statement ^ Seismic Resistance^
| Lateral load path | The structure contains a complete load path for seismic force effects from any horizontal direction that serves to transfer inertial forces from the building to the foundation. | N/A |
| Building Configuration-Vertical | The building is regular with regards to the elevation. (Specify in 5.4.1) | N/A |
| Building Configuration-Horizontal | The building is regular with regards to the plan. (Specify in 5.4.2) | N/A |
| Roof Construction | The roof diaphragm is considered to be rigid and it is expected that the roof structure will maintain its integrity, i.e. shape and form, during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. | N/A |
| Floor Construction | The floor diaphragm(s) are considered to be rigid and it is expected that the floor structure(s) will maintain its integrity during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. | N/A |
| Foundation Performance | There is no evidence of excessive foundation movement (e.g. settlement) that would affect the integrity or performance of the structure in an earthquake. | N/A |
| Wall and Frame Structures-Redundancy | The number of lines of walls or frames in each principal direction is greater than or equal to 2. | N/A |
| Wall Proportions | Height-to-thickness ratio of the shear walls at each floor level is: Less than 25 (concrete walls); Less than 30 (reinforced masonry walls); Less than 13 (unreinforced masonry walls); | N/A |
| Foundation-Wall Connection | Vertical load-bearing elements (columns, walls) are attached to the foundations; concrete columns and walls are doweled into the foundation. | N/A |
| Wall-Roof Connections | Exterior walls are anchored for out-of-plane seismic effects at each diaphragm level with metal anchors or straps. | N/A |
| Wall Openings |  | N/A |
| Quality of Building Materials | Quality of building materials is considered to be adequate per the requirements of national codes and standards (an estimate). | N/A |
| Quality of Workmanship | Quality of workmanship (based on visual inspection of a few typical buildings) is considered to be good (per local construction standards). | N/A |
| Maintenance | Buildings of this type are generally well maintained and there are no visible signs of deterioration of building elements (concrete, steel, timber). | N/A |
