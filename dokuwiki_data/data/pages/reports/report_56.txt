**Report** 56

**Building Type:** Timber log building

**Country:** Russia

**Author(s):** Mark Klyachko, Andrey Benin, Janna Bagdanova

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus) where this construction type covers 5 to100% of the housing stock. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.

**Summary:** This is a rural housing construction practice widespread in the Russian forests. Buildings of this type are common for seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus). The load-bearing structure is made of wood. Walls are made of horizontal sawn timber logs of square or circular cross section with special end joints (similar to dovetail joints). Buildings have timber roof and fieldstone or concrete strip foundation. Typical seria 146-115-77 cm of #Giprolesprom# for seismic regions is an example of this building type. Seismic performance of these buildings is good, provided the quality of construction is adequate.
