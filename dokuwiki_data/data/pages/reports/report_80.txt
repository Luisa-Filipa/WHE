==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 80

**Building Type:** Low-strength dressed stone masonry buildings

**Country:** India

**Author(s):** Ravi Sinha, Vijaya R. Ambati

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in urban and rural areas throughout India. A very large proportion of the building stock in the Kutch region of Gujarat affected by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake was of this construction type. This type of construction is also used in other regions of India with lower seismic hazard where soft stone is easily available. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** Construction of stone masonry buildings using easily available local materials is a common practice in both urban and rural parts of India. Stone masonry houses are used by the middle class and lower middle class people in urban areas, and by all classes in rural areas. In rural areas, buildings of this type are generally smaller in size and are used as single-storey single-family housing. In urban areas, these buildings are up to 4 storeys high and they are used for multi-family housing. This is a typical load bearing construction, in which both gravity and lateral loads are resisted by the walls supported by strip footing. Dressed (shaped) stones are commonly used when the locally available stone is soft and can be chiseled at low or moderate cost. Mud or lime mortar has been used in traditional constructions; however, the use of cement mortar is also becoming more prevalent in recent times. Due to easy availability of soft sandstone in Kutch region of the Gujarat state (western part of India), stone block masonry constructions are widely used for both single-storey as well as multi-storey constructions. These houses are usually constructed by local artisans without formal training and the resulting constructions are structurally weak and incapable of resisting large seismic forces. In the Kutch region of Gujarat state, which was affected by the 2001 Bhuj earthquake this construction type is commonly used with gable end timber roof truss or RCC roof slabs. Thousands of houses of this type collapsed in the 2001 Bhuj earthquake resulting in the death of a large number of people. This construction type is inherently unsuitable for areas of moderate to high seismic hazard, such as the Kutch region of Gujarat.

==== 2. Features ====

{{gallery>:reports:report_80?rp80_features_*.jpg&200x200&lightbox&crop&4 | }}

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 15-20

**Typical plan width (meters):** 7.5-10

**Typical story height (meters):** 3

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Massive stone masonry (in lime/cement mortar)

**Additional comments on structural system:** The gravity load-bearing system consists of the walls which carry the floor and roof loads. The walls, in turn, transmit the loads to the foundations, which consist of strip footings, which vary in depth from 0.5m to 2.0 m (depending on the number of stories and the local soil conditions). Most rural houses have gable end timber roof truss with conventional or Mangalore type clay tiles as roofing resting on Bamboo or timber purlins. The urban constructions and other multi-storeyed buildings have used reinforced concrete (RCC) floor slabs. This housing type is characterized with rather poor lateral load resistance. Lateral loads are resisted by the stone masonry walls; however, due to the low strength of walls in these constructions (due to use of low-strength mortar and absence of earthquake-resistant features), the walls are vulnerable to earthquake effects. In single-storey constructions, the roof may consist of wall-supported flexible truss, which is not effective in distributing the storey-level inertia forces to the different resisting elements. In these constructions, openings are often found near the corners which further weaken their resistance to lateral loads.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 5-10%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 5-10%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is 5% - 10%. The wall density is the same in both directions.

**Wall Openings:** The number of openings in each floor depends on the number of housing units existing on that floor. There are typically 8 doors and 10 windows in a typical 2-bedroom housing unit. The window size ranges from 1.0m X 1.2m to 2.0m X 1.2m and the door size ranges from 0.75m X 2.1m to 1.0m X 2.1m. The doors are usually located at wall junctions and the windows at both the center and corners of the wall.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** Significant structural modifications to these buildings have not been observed. However, in rural and semi-urban areas, construction may be carried out incrementally

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** 

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Solid slabs (cast-in-place), Wood plank, plywood or manufactured wood panels on joists supported by beams or walls. The flooring system could be either of these two choices. Most recent constructions in urban areas use RCC floor.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Most recent constructions in urban areas use RCC roof slabs. Solid slabs (cast-in-place)

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 5 meters.

=== Construction Process ===

**Who typically builds this construction type?** MasonBuilderOther

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** In rural areas, the owner typically lives in this construction type. In urban areas, such dwellings are also sometimes built by developers for sale.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** The local artisans carry out the construction with the assistance of unskilled labor.

**Construction process and phasing:** The construction process is totally manual and very low-tech. The local stone blocks are purchased along with rubble stones for foundation. The construction is carried out by local skilled or semi-skilled artisans with the assistance of unskilled assistants. Engineers and architects are generally not involved in the process. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size.

=== Past Earthquakes in the country which affected buildings of this type===

^ Year ^ Earthquake Epicenter ^ Richter Magnitude  ^ Maximum Intensity ^ 
| 2001 | Bhuj, Gujarat | 7.6 | X (MSK) | 
| 1819 | Kutch, Gujarat | 8.1 | XI (MSK) |

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** During the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, a very large number of stone masonry houses collapsed or were severely damaged, resulting in a large number of casualties. Old stone masonry houses, which were typically constructed using mud or lime mortar performed very poorly and exhibited brittle collapse. Thick multi-wythe walls experienced separation of wythe resulting in loss of strength. Stone masonry houses constructed with cement mortar exhibited relatively higher resistance to the earthquake. However, the number of such houses was very small. It is interesting that "engineered" stone masonry houses, which were designed with technical assistance from Architect and Engineers also did not have earthquake-resistant features as specified in the Indian Code of Practice for such structures.

**Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:** Walls: -Out of plane wall failure; -Failure of wall corners and junctions; -Bulging type failure of the wall; -Vertical shearing of wall; -Shear failure of walls near openings. Roof/Floor: -Movement of roof relative to the wall causing sliding of roof structure and complete failure in some cases.

==== 6. Retrofit Information ====

{{gallery>:reports:report_80?rp80_retrofit_*.jpg&200x200&lightbox&crop&4 | }}

=== Description of Seismic Strengthening Provisions ===

^ Structural Deficiency ^ Seismic Strengthening ^
| Inadequate lateral load resistance of masonry walls due to the absence of through stones in the walls | Lateral strength of masonry units can be increased by inserting new walls in one or both directions; through-stones can also be added to tie the wythes. | 
| Inadequate timber roof joists-wall connections | Installation of proper roof-wall connections; addition of vertical reinforcement at the corners to tie the intersecting walls. | 
| Heavy clay roofing tiles | Tiled roofs are replaced by corrugated iron or asbestos sheet roofing. | 
| Absence of horizontal bracing between trusses along with vertical post and improper connections. | Roof trusses are braced by welding or clamping with suitable diagonal bracing members in vertical as well as horizontal planes. | 

----

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** New Construction: -Use of horizontal bands at plinth, lintel and roof levels: Use of bands ties the walls together and ensures effective load transfer under earthquake loading -Vertical reinforcement adjacent to openings and at the wall corners: Vertical reinforcement confines the masonry under earthquake loading and increases its earthquake resistance. -Rigid concrete (RCC) roof slabs or light-weight truss roof: Concrete (RCC) roof slabs are very effective in transferring the inertia forces between the different walls. Use of low weight truss roof reduces the inertia force under earthquake loading

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** After the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, the existing stone masonry structures in Kutch district are to be retrofitted as described above by the individual house owners.

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** The strengthening is to be carried out to both damaged as well as undamaged structures.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** There is no effective inspection and monitoring mechanism.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** The constructions do not use engineers, and are carried out by the contractor or the owner.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?** Not Applicable
