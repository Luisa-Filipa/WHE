**Country:** Russia

**Author(s):** Mark Klyachko, Yuriy Gordeev, Freda Kolosova

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus) and CIS states (Central Asia, Armenia, Georgia, etc.) where it accounts for 10 to 15% of the housing stock.

**Summary:** This is a typical residential construction found both in urban and rural areas. It represents a construction practice followed in the former Soviet Union. Buildings of this type constitute 15 to 30% of the housing stock in seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, BaikalLake Region, North Caucasus) and in CIS states (Central Asia, Armenia, Georgia, etc.). The main load-bearing system for lateral and gravity loads consists of concrete block masonry walls and concrete floor slabs. Seismic resistance is relatively good, provided that the welded block wall connections are present and well constructed.

----

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** The recommended methods for seismic strengthening of buildings of this construction type are: METHOD OF EXTERIOR FRAME (MEF) Goal: To increase lateral seismic stability of buildings with load-bearing masonry or large-block concrete walls. Concept: The system of precast or "cast-in-situ" concrete buttresses (counterforts) (1) tied to the longitudinal exterior wall. Application: This method has been used successfully for seismic strengthening of buildings with longitudinal bearing walls and deficient lateral earthquake resistance both as self-contained strengthening system and as a combination with PTS (for stringer walls) or with SIS (for extended masonry buildings with widely spaced lateral inner walls). Description: The MEF is performed by constructing special concrete buttresses (counterforts) tied to the longitudinal load-bearing walls at the building ends and other locations as required. In order to ensure a uniform seismic performance of the existing structure strengthened with the buttresses, the buttresses are tied to the existing walls by means of the dowels and anchors. This solution does not require the pairs of buttresses (counterforts) to be tied at each floor level; it is considered to be adequate to install a prestressed tie to connect the buttresses (counterforts) at the roof level. STRENGTHENING OF BUILDINGS USING THE POST # TENSIONING SYSTEM (PTS) Goal: To increase seismic resistance of existing buildings. Concept: The reduction in principal tensile stresses induced by seismic loads to allowable levels. Description and sequence of operations: -Drilling of the vertical holes is carried out by means of special equipment; the amount of opening (10) is not less than one for each partition. -The wire cables (2) are pulled through each opening (10). -Cables are anchored at the basement level and then post-tensioned up to 1600 KN. -A special cement-based grout (1) is injected into the holes and the cables are subsequently anchored at the roof level. The post-tensioning of walls prevents the formation of cracks in an earthquake and results in the increased seismic resistance of the indivdual walls and the building as a whole. Equipment: For drilling: "GEARMEC" (Sweden); for post-tensioning: IMS system (Yugoslavia). THE METHOD OF ADDED STIFFNESS (SIS) Goal: Seismic strengthening of masonry buildings to achieve increased seismic reliability and safety. Concept: The stiffness increase is achieved by means of a new reinforced concrete wall (overlay) attached to the existing wall. In this way, the coupled perforated shear walls are formed, and lateral seismic loads are redistributed: the seismic loads remove on the spine walls from principal one. Description: The SIS method consists of constructing new cast-in-situ concrete walls (1) of 10-15 cm thickness reinforced with steel wire mesh. The new walls are attached to the existing ones using dowels (3) and anchors (4). The new walls may be constructed with additional pilasters (2) if required. Equipment: Sheathing "MEVA" (Germany), instruments: "Bosch" and "Hilti" (Germany). THE METHOD OF UPPER DAMPING STOREY (UDS) Goal: To develop a big mass damper for the self-damping of buildings under seismic impact. Concept: To achieve a flexible structure with stiffness and mass capable of reducing the seismic demand in an existing building to a permissible level. Application: Masonry or block buildings with deficient seismic resistance D=2.0 (MSK scale). A very effective application for 4- to 5-story residential masonry and large-block houses with D=1.0-1.5. The superstructure can be constructed as a "cold" garret or as additional floor (duplex apartment).

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?:** Yes. A number of buildings of this type have been strengthened using the above described methodology.

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?:** In most cases repair was executed after earthquake damage.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?:** Yes

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?:** Strengthening of buildings is accomplished by contractor. All processes are controlled by engineers.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?:** N/A
