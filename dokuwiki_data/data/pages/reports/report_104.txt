==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 104

**Building Type:** Adobe / Earthen House

**Country:** IRAN

**Author(s):** Mehrdad Mehrain, Farzad Naeim

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the Middle East. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This building type is typically one or two stories and used for single-family housing. It is more predominant in the desert, in cold-weather, or other inhospitable climates. It has a large mass and basically no strength, particularly against out-of-plane wall forces. These buildings are the most seismically vulnerable. In the 2003 Bam earthquake, collapse of these buildings was widespread and contributed to many of the 43,000+ deaths. The typical mode of collapse is out-of-plane failure of the walls, resulting in loss of support for the roof. Adobe construction is widespread throughout Iran, and is used both by wealthy families in luxury residences, as well as by poor families in more modest dwellings.

**Length of time practiced:** More than 200 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 1

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** 4

**Comments:** Adobe construction is widespread throughout Iran, and is used both by wealthy families in luxury residences as well as poor fami

==== 2. Features ====

{{gallery>:reports:report_104?rp104_features_*.jpg&200x200&lightbox&crop&4 | }}

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, with an opening in plan

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Small windows, one entrance door and one entry for each room.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 12

**Typical plan width (meters):** 12

**Typical story height (meters):** 3

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Adobe block walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls . The roofs are usually adobe domes or cylindrical arches, supported on adobe walls. Sometimes flat adobe roofs with wood joists are used (as described in section 1.9, if these buildings are built on hillsides, the ground floor of one building can be the roof for another.) . The lateral load-resisting system is earthen walls . The lateral load-resisting elements are adobe walls, typically 3 m high, 4 m wide and 0.80 m thick. The walls do not have any additional system (such as crown beam or pilasters) to restrain their out-of-plane movement. That is one reason why the buildings are so vulnerable in earthquakes. If the walls move out of plane, the roof loses its support, and collapses .

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** >20%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** >20%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density varies from 10% to 35%. The walls are very thick, typically +/- 70-80 cm.

**Wall Openings:** Small windows, one entrance door and one entry for each room. Opening area is about 30 percent of total wall area .

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** Yes

**Modifications of buildings:** No modifications are made to the building .

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** 

**Type of Floor System:** Vaulted masonry floorOther floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** 

**Type of Roof System:** Vaulted masonry roofRoof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** The roofs (and walls) typically have a 5 cm (2 inch) layer of straw reinforced mud to provide protection against rain .

**Additional comments section 2:** The typical separation distance between buildings is more than one meter, if not connected to adjacent buildings.

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** 

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** No special expertise . None .

**Construction process and phasing:** Sun dried adobe units are used to build walls and roof. A 2-inch layer of straw-reinforced mud covers the walls and roof for rain protection. Every 4 to 6 years, this layer is washed away from the roof and requires replacement. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.
