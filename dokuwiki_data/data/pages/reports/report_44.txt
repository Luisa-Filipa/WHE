**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in almost all parts of Malaysia. This type of housing construction iscommonly found in both rural and urban areas. About 30-40% are located in semi-urban areas.

**Summary:** This housing type is commonly used for family housing and it is found in urban areas of Malaysia.Columns and beams are of reinforced concrete to provide structural strengths. Roof consists oftimber trusses. These houses are designed according to the British Code BS 8110 without seismicdesign considerations.

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** The typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular shape.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 6

**Typical plan width (meters):** 20

**Typical story height (meters):** 4-Mar

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Designed for gravity loads only, with URM infill walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. Columns and walls give stiffness tothe structure, which controls the lateral drift. The common size of columns is 600 mm X 600 mm and for walls are150 mm thickness.The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). The roofs are designed totransmit gravity loads to the slabs, beams, and columns. The walls are from the non-load bearing wall system. Allexternal walls and partition walls are 9-inch brick walls. Internal partitions are timber framing.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** Structural Concrete: Moment resisting frame, designed for gravity loads only (predating seismic codes i.e. no seismic features)

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** 

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation

**Additional comments on foundation:** The typical separation distance between buildings is 10 meters or more.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerArchitect

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Engineers are in charge of the structural design and the construction process. Architects are in charge of the architectural design.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** Engineers and architects have experience in design and construction process. This is one of the most typicalconstructions in Malaysia, so there are good capable professionals with experience on this kind ofbuilding.

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** It is more typically built by developers or for speculation.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** 

**Construction process and phasing:** Developers normally build structures of this type. Process start with the foundation of the building, then columns and brick walls are built, finally beams and roofs are made at the time to get a monolithic structure. The tools typically used in this type of construction, are hammers,nails, construction wire, etc. and the equipment used include concrete vibrator, concrete mixer and others. To start the construction of the building one needs to get a construction license. Municipal authorities are in charge of giving this license to the builder companies.Each housing project must have four kinds of technical drawings: structural drawings, architectural drawings, water installation drawings and electric installation drawings. Municipal authorities need to approve this technical information in order to get construction license.Construction typically takes place over time, buildings are originally designed for a specific number of stories. However, it is commonly found that o
wners decide to build additional stories some years later of the end of the original construction.

**Construction issues:**

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** BS 8110 (British Standard). The year thefirst code/standard addressing this type of construction issued was 1980's. The BS 8110 code also includes nationalbuilding codes, specifications for materials and seismic standards.

**Process for building code enforcement:** Municipal authorities just approve the design of the building. Typically, the owner hires aparticular supervisor for construction of the building.

=== Construction Economics === 

**Unit construction cost:** Unit construction cost is approximately 13.3 US$/sq. m.

**Labor requirements:** This type of building needs about 12 months or more to complete the construction. However, thetime required does not depend on the architectural characteristics of the building.

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

The main reference publication used in developing the statements used in this table is FEMA 310 “Handbook for the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings-A Pre-standard”, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, D.C., 1998.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.

| Foundation Performance | There is no evidence of excessive foundation movement (e.g. settlement) that would affect the integrity or performance of the structure in an earthquake. | TRUE | 
| Wall and Frame Structures-Redundancy | The number of lines of walls or frames in each principal direction is greater than or equal to 2. | TRUE | 
| Wall Proportions | Height-to-thickness ratio of the shear walls at each floor level is: Less than 25 (concrete walls); Less than 30 (reinforced masonry walls); Less than 13 (unreinforced masonry walls); | TRUE |

| Wall-Roof Connections | Exterior walls are anchored for out-of-plane seismic effects at each diaphragm level with metal anchors or straps. | FALSE | 
| Wall Openings |  | TRUE | 
| Quality of Building Materials | Quality of building materials is considered to be adequate per the requirements of national codes and standards (an estimate). | TRUE | 
| Quality of Workmanship | Quality of workmanship (based on visual inspection of a few typical buildings) is considered to be good (per local construction standards). | TRUE |
