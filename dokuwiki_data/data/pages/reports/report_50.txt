==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 50

**Building Type:** Confined masonry building

**Country:** Peru

**Author(s):** Cesar Loaiza, Marcial Blondet

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Peru, particularly in the coastal region. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** This multifamily housing construction type has been the most commonly used in the urban areas of Peru during the last 35 years. Confined masonry buildings consist of load-bearing unreinforced clay masonry walls confined by cast-in-place reinforced concrete tie columns and beams. Tie columns are cast after the construction of the masonry walls is complete and theyare connected to the tie beams. Confined masonry walls have limited shear strength and ductility; however, buildings of this type typically have a good seismic resistance.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Mixed residential/commercial

**Typical number of stories:** 4-6

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** 3

**Comments:** Average 6 units in each building; usually there are from 4 to 8 units in each building.

==== 2. Features ====

{{gallery>:reports:report_50?rp50_features_*.jpg&200x200&lightbox&crop&4 | }}

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 20

**Typical plan width (meters):** 12

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.7

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Confined Masonry: Concrete blocks, tie columns and beams

**Additional comments on structural system:** Lateral-load resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. Confined masonry walls give stiffness to the structure and control lateral drift. Tie columns and post beams prevent damage due to out-of-plane bending effects and improve wall ductility. Tie columns have the longitudinal reinforcement necessary to resist overturning moments. In some cases, reinforced concrete walls are required to avoid cracking of reinforced concrete elements. Gravity load-bearing system: Generally, the same system as described above. Floor and roof structures are composite structures, made of masonry units and concrete joists that transfer the gravity loads to the walls.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 4-5%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 4-5%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 5 %. Total wall area/plan area (for each floor) is 3-5%.

**Wall Openings:** A typical building has 3 to 4 windows (typically 1 to 2 m wide) in each in the longitudinal direction. In the transverse direction there may be one or two openings per facade.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** In some cases owners build additional interior walls as a part of the building extension (new rooms or bathrooms).

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** Usually the foundation is of plain (unreinforced) concrete unless the soil is clay or silt

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Composite masonry and concrete joist; in the analysis, the floors are considered to be rigid diaphragms.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Composite masonry and concrete joist.

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 0.5-1.0 meters. Average plan area is 260 m.sq. Length varies from 15 to 30 m, and the width varies from 5 to 15 m. Story height varies from 2.5 meters to 2.8 meters.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerArchitect

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Engineers are in charge of the structural design and construction process. Architects are in charge of the architectural design and in some cases in charge of the construction process.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** Both the structural and the construction engineer should have 5 years of study and minimum work experience of 2 years.

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** Construction companies build the buildings of this type and sell them.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** Both the structural and the construction engineer should have 5 years of study and minimum work experience of 2 years. Commonly, the construction process is inspected. The designer may visit the construction process once or twice during the construction.

**Construction process and phasing:** Masonry walls are built with serrated endings, then tie columns are cast against them. After that tie beams, lintels and floors are built simultaneously. The equipment commonly used is: concrete mixer, traveling crane, winch, trucks. Typically not built incrementally, buildings originally designed for final constructed size.

**Construction issues:** -Walls or opening end zones without confinement; -Poor quality of mortar; -Deficient construction joints; -Inadequate reinforcement detailing at the tie-column-to-tie beam joints.

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** 

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** Yes, parapets are confined and non structural walls are isolated from the structure.
