**Country:** Russia

**Author(s):** Mark Klyachko, Igor Mortchikchin, Igor Nudga

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in Russia and Central Asia. It constitutes between 20 and 100 % of the housing stock in seismic zones of Russia and Central Asia. Large panel construction of Seria 122 is common for the areas with extremely severe climate (East Siberia and North Far East), Seria 135 can be found in Russia (Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus) and CIS countries (Caucasus), whereas the Seria 1-464c is found in seismic prone areas of Russia (Far East-Kamchatka) and CIS (Central Asia). This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** Large panel buildings represent one of the most common multifamily housing construction types (apartment buildings) in the former Soviet Union. Buildings of this type range from 4 to 9 stories high. This construction practice started in the 1960s and has been followed ever since. This contribution describes three different types (series) of large panel construction, known as seria 122, seria 135, and seria 1-464c. These three types (seria) are characterized by welded panel connections. The main vertical load-bearing elements, designed to carry both gravity and lateral loads, are precast reinforced concrete panels. Typically, buildings are of a regular plan and are characterized with only one interior load-bearing wall in the longitudinal direction and several walls in the transverse direction. Floor and roof structures are also made of precast reinforced concrete panels. Both wall and floor panels are of room dimensions, and the assembly of these structures consists of setting the panels in their final position and joining them in a box-type structure by means of welded joints. The methodology of achieving panel connections in large panel construction practice has significantly improved in the last 50 years. Seria 1-464c is among the first seria of large panel construction. Initially, panel joints in seria 1-464c were achieved by welding the steel elements projecting from the panels. Later on, welded joints were replaced with the monolithic joints. Seria 1-464c is characterized by a plan typical for large panel buildings with continuous walls and a typical span (2.7 m or 3.6 m) of cross walls (Figures 8 and 9). Seria 122 is characterized by discontinuous facade walls in the longitudinal direction (Figure 6). Seria 135 is characterized by a larger span of cross walls (6m) as compared to the other types (see Figure 7). Due to the large wall density, these buildings are rather rigid. Seismic resistance in this construction type is generally good, as these buildings have been exposed to several strong earthquakes in

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Large panel precast walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** Gravity Load-Resisting System: Longitudinal and cross walls and floor slabs. Lateral-load system is a rigid 3-D box-type structure, which consists of precast reinforced concrete wall and floor panels. Panels are joined together by means of special joints (either welded or monolithic). In the initial stage of large panel construction, the panels were joined together by means of welding. Wall panels have steel plate elements at the top and bottom end which are welded with similar elements of other panels (Figure 12). The connection between the floor panels (Figure 11) and the wall panels is achieved by welding the steel elements (see Figure 13). In case of monolithic joints, vertical wall panel joints comprise of vertical steel bars projected from the panels, horizontal lapping steel and grooved panel surface. After the panel erection is complete and the steel bars are welded to the lapping steel, the gap is filled with concrete.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** 1971 Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka earthquake (Richter magnitude 7.2) - panel buildings were not damaged in this earthquake. Also, panel buildings were not damaged in the 1966 Tashkent (Uzbekistan) earthquake (I=8). However, it should be noted that large panel buildings were not located in the epicentral zone of the Tashkent earthquake; they were located in the area with intensity of less than 7 on MSK skale. Many large panel buildings were damaged in the second Gazly earthquake of 1976; this can be explained by seismic impact on the buildings already damaged in the previous Gazly earthquake that occurred in the same year (1976). Before the 1976 earthquake, the Gazly area was considered as zone of moderate seismic risk (intensity 6 per MSK scale). Consequently, buildings were not characterized with any seismic provisions. Panel joints were not adequate for seismic conditions, however in spite of that, these buildings suffered much less damage as compared to other building types. Damages to large panel buildings in the Gazly earthquake are not typical for the performance of large buildings in seismic zones. It was observed that some exterior wall panels toppled and fell off the buildings. Damage to large panel buildings in the 1976 Gazly earthquake is shown on Figure 14. Panel buildings suffered only a minor damage in the 1988 Spitak, Armenia earthquake. However, these panel buildings were of different type (Seria A1-451 KP-16/1), which is similar to the construction described in another contribution by Itskov, Ashimbayev and Chernov (Kazakhstan) on large panel construction with two longitudinal walls.
