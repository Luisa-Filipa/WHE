==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 97

**Building Type:** Medium/high rise moment resisting reinforced concrete frame building

**Country:** Romania

**Author(s):** Maria D. Bostenaru

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in Romania. According to Balan (1982), 90% of the building stock inRomania at the time of writing, was built after 1950. In Bucharest itself, between 1950 and the earthquake thatoccurred in 1977, a total of around 400,000 new residential apartment units were constructed, and two thirds of thesewere housed in medium rise constructions. Out of the latter about 4% where built using a reinforced concrete framestructure. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** Such buildings generally range from 10 to 17 storeys in height with the ground floor being usedfor commercial purposes, whilst the upper floors house residential units. The vertical loadbearing structure consists of moment-resisting reinforced-concrete frames which also generallyserve as the lateral load-resisting system. However, when larger spans are encountered,reinforced-concrete structural walls are included to provide a dual structural system. Masonryinfills built from lightweight concrete masonry units provide architectural space delineation.The seismic performance of such buildings constructed prior to 1977 varies from no damageto complete collapse. To date damage has usually been attributable to conceptual andconstruction mistakes.

**Length of time practiced:** Less than 25 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 20-49 unitsMixed residential/commercial

**Typical number of stories:** 4-18

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** 3

**Comments:** After 1990 new buildings were no longer constructed in thearchitectural socialist post-modern style. Two buildings of this latte

{{gallery>:reports:report_97?rp97_features_*.jpg&200x200&lightbox&crop&4 | }}

**Plan Shape:** Square, solidRectangular, solidL-shapeU- or C-shape

**Additional comments on plan shape:** The plan shape can be any shape, but most typically it is either a rectangular, square, L or U layout.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 12.7-30

**Typical plan width (meters):** 12-17

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.75

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Designed for gravity loads only, with URM infill walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. Monolithic cast in-situ reinforcedconcrete slabs transfer the gravity loads to the reinforced concrete beam and column framing down to the foundation.Various architectural requirements give rise to particular cases, such as where window openings result in the beamsbeing cast as up-stands rather than down-stands. Furthermore, in some cases brick masonry infills might actually carry some local vertical load.The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. The main lateral load resisting systemis provided by the reinforced concrete moment resisting frames. The infills then, although notaccounted for in design, invariably contribute to the building's stiffness. The use of a higher storey height for the lowerfloor for commercial purposes gives rise to an increased likelihood of a soft storey mechanism.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 5-10%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 5-10%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural walldensity is up to 10 %. The above values are for the (lightweight concrete) infill walls.

**Wall Openings:** Openings areformed in the masonry infill (see fig. 2,2B and 2C). Since the masonry infill is usually out of light concrete (betoncelular autoclavizat), the position and size of openings is not generally considered to influence the structuralcharacteristics at the design stage.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** The light partition/infill walls have allowed for numerous modifications to the interior spaces of these buildingswithout directly influencing the geometrical characteristics of the main reinforced concrete structural members. After1990 many facades of these constructions have been modified with balconies being closed off and included in the glassand metal facade structures installed.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Mat foundation

**Additional comments on foundation:** Probably other foundation forms are encountered, such as piles in certain cases.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Solid slabs (cast-in-place); Solid slabs (precast)

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Solid slabs (cast-in-place); Solid slabs (precast)

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** According to Balan (1982), during the 1977 earthquake, damage was typically concentrated locally in the reinforcedconcrete columns and beams on the ground floor and up to the fourth storey. Furthermore, severedamage to the masonry infill walls was evidenced as well.

**Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:** Weak storey: slender columns, concrete spalling, buckling of thereinforcement in plastic hinge locations. Central andshort columns suffer, stirrup rupture, column dislocation, cracks,brittle failures especially at the intersection with staircases which giverise to a captive column effect. Typical storeys: In the columns,horizontal cracks directly under/over the beams, orthogonally to thecolumn axis, concrete spalling, buckling of the reinforcement bars atplastic hinges, inclined X-shaped cracks. In thebeams, larger span beams suffer from concrete spalling in the plastichinge zones. Cracks in the beam-column connections. Inshorter span beams, inclined cracks on the lower half of the beams.Inclined X-shaped cracks, vertical flexural cracks in secondary beams. Superficial cracks in the plastering, separation cracks on the perimeter.Inclined X-cracks, sliding failure in the first storey and atconstruction joints, partial or complete failure of the masonry, deformation of the window frames with glass breakages, cracksin the lintels, disintegration of the partition walls especially whereconstruction joints are present. Cracks in the lower storeys, at interaction with central and shortcolumn.

**Additional comments on structural and architectural features for seismic resistance:** 

**Vertical irregularities typically found in this construction type:** Other

**Horizontal irregularities typically found in this construction type:** Other

**Seismic deficiency in walls:** 

**Earthquake-resilient features in walls:** 

**Seismic deficiency in frames:** Where commercial premises are housed a softstorey mechanism can be prevalent, due to thelarger storey heights and possible larger spans. During the structural design,the influence of the masonry infills is not takeninto account. The amount of reinforcement inthe main structural members is not alwaysexactly prescribed. The detailing of the beam-columnconnections. Poor construction materialquality, mistakes during construction, such asout-of-plumb columns. Where precast structuralmembers are used the connections are a causeof concern.

**Earthquake-resilient features in frame:** A regular andthree dimensionalcolumn grid givingrise to a robustmoment resistingspatial framesystem. In somebuildingsstructuralreinforcedconcrete walls areincorporated togive rise to a dualsystem.

**Seismic deficiency in roof and floors:** 

**Earthquake resilient features in roof and floors:** Stiff cast in-situ floors
