**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the seismic zones of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus) and CIS (Central Asia, Armenia, Georgia, etc.) where it represents 15-30% of the housing stock. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This is a typical residential construction found both in urban and rural areas. It represents a construction practice followed in the former Soviet Union. Buildings of this type constitute 15 to 30% of the housing stock in seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region, North Caucasus) and CIS states (Central Asia, Armenia, Georgia, etc.). The main loadbearing system for lateral and gravity loads consists of concrete block masonry walls and concrete floor slabs. Seismic resistance is relatively good, provided that the welded block wall connections are present and are well constructed.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** Typical earthquake damage patterns for this construction type are illustrated in Figures 6 to 12. Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the seismic performance of this construction type in the 1995 Neftegorsk earthquake. At the time of the earthquake, there were 17 five-story large-block residential buildings constructed in the period 1967-1971. These buildings were constructed without any seismic provisions. All 17 buildings collapsed in the earthquake, as illustrated in Figure 13. Several two-story large-block buildings were also exposed to the Neftegorsk earthquake (see Figure 14), however these buildings had suffered some damages, e.g. vertical and horizontal cracks between blocks, diagonal cracks in partitions, vertical cracks in the wall connections, partial damage to chimneys, and displacement of entrance canopies. For more information on the Neftegorsk earthquake, refer to Klyachko (1999) and Melentyev (1999).

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** The recommended seismic strengthening techniques are: THE METHOD OF EXTERIOR FRAME (MEF) Goal: To increase lateral seismic stability of the building with load-bearing masonry or large-block concrete walls. Concept: The system of precast or "cast-in-situ" concrete buttresses (counterforts) (1) tied to the longitudinal exterior wall. Application: This method has been used successfully for seismic strengthening of the buildings with longitudinal bearing walls and deficient seismic resistance both as self-contained strengthening system and as a combination with PTS (for stringer walls) or with SIS (for extended masonry buildings with widely spaced lateral inner walls). Description: The MEF is performed by constructing special concrete buttresses (counterforts) tied to the longitudinal load-bearing walls at the building ends and other locations as required. In order to ensure a uniform seismic performance of the existing structure strengthened with the buttresses, the buttresses are tied to the existing walls by means of the dowels and anchors. This solution does not require to tie the pairs of buttresses (counterforts) together at each floor level. Instead, it is adequate to install a prestressed tie to connect the buttresses (counterforts) at the roof level. STRENGTHENING OF BUILDINGS USING THE POST#TENSIONING SYSTEM (PTS) Goal: To increase seismic resistance of loadbearing masonry buildings. Concept: Reduction in the principal tensile stresses induced by seismic loads to allowable levels. Description and sequence of operations: # Drilling of the vertical holes is carried out by means of special equipment; the amount of opening (10) is not less than one for each partition. # The wire cables (2) are pulled through each opening (10). # Cables are anchored at the basement level and then post-tensioned up to 1600 KN. # A special cement-based grout (1) is injected into the holes and the cables are subsequently anchored at the roof level. Post-tensioning of walls prevents the formation of cracks in an earthquake and results in the increased seismic resistance of the individual walls and the building as a whole. Equipment: For drilling: "GEARMEC" (Sweden); for post-tensioning: IMS system (Yugoslavia). THE METHOD OF UPPER DAMPING STOREY (UDS) Goal: To develop a big mass damper for the self-damping of buildings under seismic impact. Idea: To achieve a flexible structure with stiffness and mass capable of reducing the seismic demand to a permissible level. Application: Masonry or block buildings with deficient seismic resistance D=2.0 (MSK scale). A highly effective and fast application for 4- to 5-story residential masonry and large-block houses with D=1.0-1.5. The superstructure can be constructed as a "cold" garret or as additional floor (duplex apartment).

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** Yes. Some buildings of this type have been strengthened using the above described methodology.

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** Some work was done as a mitigation effort (stregthening of undamaged existing buildings), and in some cases earthquake-damaged buildings were strengthened.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** Yes.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** Strengthening is done in a similar way as new construction. The construction is done by the contractor. Engineers manage each stage of construction.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?** Information not available.
