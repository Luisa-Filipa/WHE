==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 70

**Building Type:** Solid brick masonry house with composite hollow clay tile and concrete joist roof slabs

**Country:** Argentina

**Author(s):** Virginia I Rodriguez, Maria I Yacante, Sergio Reiloba

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in Argentina. Nowadays, this housing type represents about 30% of all the houses built in the capital city of the province of San Juan, reaching 70% in certain neighborhoods. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** This housing type is found in the urban areas of the Province of San Juan. It is a one-story, detached or semi-detached building, mainly used as a single-family house. The strength of this construction type is due to its solid brick walls confined with concrete tie-beams and tie-columns. The roof slabs are of composite concrete and masonry hollow clay tile construction, which form a diaphragm tied to the walls. The deficiency of this type of construction is found in the slabs which suffer serious deterioration due to the effects of humidity. This housing type is expected to have good seismic behaviour.

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 1

=== Design Process ===

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerArchitect

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Architects are in charge of the architectural design and they are sometimes responsible for the construction process of this housing type. Engineers work in structural design and sometimes in the construction process too.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** This construction type was most prevalent between 1950 and 1970. Nowadays it is rarely built. Architects and engineers involved in the design and construction process acquired a good level of expertise since the reconstruction of the city of San Juan after the earthquake of 1944.

=== Construction Process ===

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** The builder usually does not live in this construction type. This type of building is designed and built by professionals.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** 

**Construction process and phasing:** This construction type is built by a construction company. The construction process begins with the digging and filling of the foundations. Then the frame of low reinforcement concrete beam and the columns are placed, later the beams are filled; the masonry is erected and the columns are filled. Finally, the frames of the top reinforcement beams are placed and the slab is built to fill with concrete all the structure at once. This construction process does not need many tools. The tools and equipment typically used are: shovels, hoes, baskets, pliers, levels, cement mixers, etc. This building is typically constructed incrementally. This construction type is designed for its final constructed size , but it is usually extended. The extensions are generally built without the participation of an architect or an engineer.

**Construction issues:** 

----

=== Building Codes and Standards===

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** "C#digo de la Edificacion de la Provincia de San Juan" The first code/standard addressing this type of construction was issued1951; the most recent code/standard addressing this construction was issued 1983. Applicable national building code, material codes and seismic code/standards: "Normas Argentinas para Construcciones Sismorresistentes" (INPRES-CIRSOC 103 Rules - 1983)The seismic code: "Normas Argentinas para Construcciones Sismorresistentes" (Reglamento INPRES-CIRSOC 103) first issued in November 1983, and nowadays in current use, allows the construction of ribbing slabs. The most recent code/standard addressing this construction type issued was 1983.

**Process for building code enforcement:** The process of application of the Building Code is -in general- appropriate. In the province of San Juan there is an official entity called Direccion de Planeamiento y Desarrollo Urbano (Planning and Urban Development Secretary) which examines and approves the projects (the functional design and the structural calculus). This office also examines the foundations and the structure (plinth, columns, beams, slabs) that must be in accordance with the previously approved project.

----

=== Construction Economics ===

**Unit construction cost:** 450 $US/m.sq.

**Labor requirements:** This construction type requires the approval of the architectural plans, the structural plans, and the sanitary installations plans by the provincial authorities; it also needs the electrical installation plans and the building permit given by the municipal authority. Nowadays, the gas installation plans are examined and approved by a private entity. This type of construction needs about 3 or 4 months to complete the construction.
