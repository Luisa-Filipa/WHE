==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 91

**Building Type:** EMSB1- single storied brick masonry house generally with GI roof

**Country:** Bangladesh

**Author(s):** Mehedi Ansary

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Bangladesh. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This is a one-story brick masonry house of fired bricks with cement or lime mortar; roof is either GI sheet or other material. These houses can be seen all over Bangladesh. During the 1918 Srimangal, 1930 Dhubri and some recent earthquakes, these type of houses suffered heavy damage. Houses with a continuous lintel suffered less.

**Length of time practiced:** 76-100 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:**

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solidL-shape

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Mostly L-shaped, sometimes rectangular.

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.8

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in lime/cement mortar

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls. Traditionally, 10 inch wall is used as load bearing walls. But sometimes poor people use 5 inch wall. Poorer construction do not have any kind of plaster. The lateral load-resisting system is earthen walls. Sometimes there is a continuous lintel, sometimes none. In earthquake prone areas like Chittagong, Sylhet etc. approximately 50% private housing units have continuous lintel. But on the government buildings, the percentage is much lower.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** Tie columns are not used.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 15-20%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 15-20%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 20 %. 15 - 20%.

**Wall Openings:** At least three for a single room (two windows and one door). The buildings generally comprise of two to three rooms. The inner and outer rooms have at least two doors. Opening per wall is around 20%. Doors and windows are located in the middle of the wall.

**Modifications of buildings:** 

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** Stepped brick foundations with cement mortars are used. Generally foundation bottom lies 2 to 3 ft below GL.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** 

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** GI roofs with purlins.

**Additional comments section 2:** In the villages this type of housing may be located several 100 meters apart. When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 2 meters.

----

==== 4. Socio-Economic Issues ====

**Patterns of occupancy:** As the joint family tradition is strong in the rural areas, an extended family occupy the housing unit. Typically, the families comprise of a father and two-three sons. As the family further expands, the sons families occupy independent units.

**Number of inhabitants in a typical building of this construction type during the evening/night:** 5-10

**Additional comments on number of inhabitants:** 

**Economic level of inhabitants:** Middle-income classHigh-income class (rich)

**Additional comments on economic level of inhabitants:** The middle class housing unit roughly costs USD 1,000, on the other hand the rich housing unit costs USD 1,500 to 2,000. Ratio of housing unit price to annual income: 1:1 or better

**Typical Source of Financing:** Owner financedPersonal savingsSmall lending institutions/microfinance institutions

**Additional comments on financing:** 

**Type of Ownership:** RentOwn outright

**Additional comments on ownership:** 

**Is earthquake insurance for this construction type typically available?:** No

**What does earthquake insurance typically cover/cost:** 

**Are premium discounts or higher coverages available for seismically strengthened buildings or new buildings built to incorporate seismically resistant features?:** No

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

The main reference publication used in developing the statements used in this table is FEMA 310 “Handbook for the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings-A Pre-standard”, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, D.C., 1998.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.

| Building Configuration-Horizontal | The building is regular with regards to the plan. (Specify in 5.4.2) | FALSE |

| Wall-Roof Connections | Exterior walls are anchored for out-of-plane seismic effects at each diaphragm level with metal anchors or straps. | FALSE | 
| Wall Openings |  | TRUE | 
| Quality of Building Materials | Quality of building materials is considered to be adequate per the requirements of national codes and standards (an estimate). | FALSE | 
| Quality of Workmanship | Quality of workmanship (based on visual inspection of a few typical buildings) is considered to be good (per local construction standards). | FALSE |

| Foundations | Strengthening of New Construction : Provision of strip foundation | 
| Walls | Strengthening of New Construction : Provision of RC ring beams at plinth, lintel etc. levels. Provision of vertical steel reinforcement bars at the wall corners and intersections. |

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** 

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** Proposed for the damaged buildings of 2003 Rangamati earthquake.

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** N/A
