==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 9

**Building Type:** Multistory base-isolated brick masonry building with reinforced concrete floors and roof

**Country:** China

**Author(s):** Fu L. Zhou, Zhong G. Xu, Wen G. Liu

**Last Updated:**

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the urban areas of western, eastern, northern, southern and central China. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** This is typically a 5- to 8-story building with commercial enterprises on the ground floor andresidences above. Brick masonry buildings have been used in China for thousands of years.This construction practice possesses the advantage of easy manufacture and low cost;however, the brittleness of the brick masonry material combined with weak seismic resistanceinduces severe damage or collapse of buildings and causes thousands of deaths during anearthquake. Since 1990, base-isolated brick masonry buildings with reinforced concretefloors/roof have been used more widely in China. The base-isolated building consists of anisolation system (laminated rubber isolation devices) superstructure and substructure. Thebase-isolation system is located on top of the walls or columns in the basement or at theground floor level of a building without a basement. The superstructure consists ofconventional multi-story brick masonry walls and reinforced concrete floors/roof. Thesubstructure is part of the building beneath the isolation system and consists of the basementand the foundation structure. The base-isolated masonry structure results in an increase inseismic safety by a factor of 4-12 times as compared to that of a non-isolation masonrystructure. The high seismic resistance of the base isolation structure house has been proven byshake table tests and in many actual earthquake events in China and other countries. The wideusage of base isolation technology indicates that the era of strong earthquake-proof buildingsis coming in China.

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 48

**Typical plan width (meters):** 12

**Typical story height (meters):** 3

**Type of Structural System:** Other: Seismic Protection Systems: Building protected with base-isolation

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced masonry walls. Gravity load is carried by the masonry load-bearingwalls, which transfer them to the foundation through the isolation pads. The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced masonry walls. System of structure: The base isolation house structuresystem consists of isolation layer (laminated rubber bearing isolators), superstructure and substructure. The isolationlayer is located on the top of walls or columns in basement or in the first story of house without basement. Thesuperstructure consists of common multi-stories brick masonry wall with reinforced concrete floors/roof, which issame as the general house structure supported on the rubber bearing isolators. The substructure consists of acommon basement and base, which is same as the general building structure. The laminated rubber bearing isolatorsare the key lateral load resisting elements of seismic resistance. Their features are: Size: diameter 350 mm - 600 mm,height 160 mm -200 mm. Component: thickness 3-8mm rubber layers bond with thickness 1-3 mm steel sheetsinterval each other. Characteristics of isolation pads: High vertical stiffness and high vertical compression capacity forsupporting superstructure. Low horizontal stiffness, large horizontal deformation capacity for isolating groundmotion.Suitable value of damping ratio for dissipating ground motion energy. Adequate initial horizontal stiffnessfor resisting wind loads. Seismic performance: During earthquake, the isolation structure will work as follows: 1. Allhorizontal deformations of superstructure elements will concentrate on the isolation layer, the structure will be keptwithin the elastic limit, so that no damages will occur in the structure. 2. The natural period of isolation structure willbecome very long due to the low horizontal stiffness of isolation layer, so that the isolation structural seismic responsewill be reduced to 1/4 - 1/8 of the non-isolation structural seismic response, protecting the structure from any damageand becoming very safe in strong earthquake. 3. The horizontal deformation of rubber bearing isolators will be limitedby enough damping ratio. 

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** Isolators consist of laminated rubber bearings. Superstructures are unreinforced brick masonry buildings withreinforced concrete floor/roof slabs.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** No damage.

**Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:** 1. The natural period of isolation structure is very long due to the low horizontal stiffness of isolation layer. Thiscauses the isolation structural seismic response to reduce to 1/4 - 1/8 of the response of similar non-isolationstructure. This protects the structure from any damage and makes it very safe in strong earthquake 2. No damage hasbeen observed for base-isolation buildings in many strong earthquakes in China so far.

==== 6. Retrofit Information ====

=== Description of Seismic Strengthening Provisions ===

^ Structural Deficiency ^ Seismic Strengthening ^
| Walls | 1. Bamboo: Several researchers have been involved with using internal horizontal and vertical bamboo, in a fashion similar to reinforced concrete masonry walls. 2. Timber ring beam: This helps to hold the walls together and facilitate transfer of loads from the roof to the walls. 3. 'Improved Adobe' has long been promoted to make adobe buildings more robust under seismic activity. The 'system' does not utilise another material, but focuses on the design and planning of adobe buildings by limiting opening sizes, plan dimensions, wall lengths and heights, and roof weight |
| Roof | Adequate connections to a top timber or concrete ring beam and stronger connections in the framing itself will help the roof act as a diaphragm. Galvanized sheet metal is now common and helps reduces high loads. For thermal and aesthetic reasons, how ever, clay tile continues to be used. |

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** No damages have been experienced for this type of buildings during past earthquakes in China. So far, there has beenno necessity to strengthen the isolation buildings. 

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** 

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** 

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** 

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** 

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?**
