==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 42

**Building Type:** Houses with mud walls and thatch roofs

**Country:** Kyrgyzstan

**Author(s):** Svetlana Uranova, Ulugbek T. Begaliev

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all regions of Kyrgyzstan. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This building type is widespread in the rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, and also in some urban areas. It is nonengineered construction. Due to its low cost, it is mainly used by poor people. Various building materials are used for this type of construction e.g. clay and straw for walls, wood for the roof structure, and stone for the foundations. In order to achieve adequate flexibility or plasticity, a small amount of clay is mixed with water. Straw is added to achieve an improved consistency. Small panel boards are used as formwork for casting mud walls. The walls are cast in lifts - a new lift is cast after the previous one has set. Windows and doors have wood lintels. Floors are made out of wood planks. Buildings of this type do not have any earthquake-resistant features and are considered to be highly vulnerable to seismic effects.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** Owner

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Buildings of this type are usually constructed by owners.

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Owner

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** 

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** Buildings of this type are constructed by unskilled persons.

**Construction process and phasing:** This building is typically constructed incrementally and is not designed for its final constructed size.

**Construction issues:** This construction type is very vulnerable to seismic effects. The construction is not performed according to the building code requirements- it is a nonengineered construction practice. However, it is a widely used construction due to its low cost, mainly by the poor sections of society.

----

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** No

**Applicable codes or standards:** This is a traditional type of construction which had been practiced before the introduction of building codes. As this is a non-engineered construction, current building codes do not address this type of construction.

----

=== Construction Economics === 

**Unit construction cost:** Load-bearing structure only approximately 10-15 US$/sq m
