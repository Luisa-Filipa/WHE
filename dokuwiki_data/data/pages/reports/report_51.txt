==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 51

**Building Type:** Confined masonry house

**Country:** Peru

**Author(s):** Cesar Loaiza, Marcial Blondet, Papa Simona

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Peru, particularly in the coastal region. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This is the most common single-family housing construction practice followed both in urban and rural areas of Peru in the last 45 years. Confined masonry buildings consist of loadbearing unreinforced masonry walls made of clay brick units, confined by cast-in-place reinforced concrete tie columns and beams. These buildings do not have a complete load path in both horizontal directions required for adequate lateral load resistance. However, in spite of that typical houses may show a good seismic performance.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 2-3

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** 3

**Comments:** Total number of housing units depends on the number of building sections. Typically, for the three-section building, the number

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solidL-shape

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Rectangular shape or L-shape.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 10-15

**Typical plan width (meters):** 5-10

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.6 - 2.8

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Confined Masonry: Clay brick masonry with concrete posts/tie columns and beams

**Additional comments on structural system:** The lateral load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. Masonry shear walls give stiffness to the structure and control lateral drifts. Tie columns and bond beams provide adequate confinement and ductility to the masonry walls. Typical houses have a good wall density in one horizontal direction, but a lower wall density in the other. This makes the house particularly vulnerable in the horizontal direction where the density is lowest. Tie columns have enough longitudinal reinforcement to resist overturning moments. Closely spaced transverse reinforcement at beam-column joints provides adequate ductility to resist seismic forces. Floors/roofs can consider to be rigid diaphragms in the analysis. Typical wall thickness is 150 mm or 250 mm. In general, the same system as describe above. Floors/roofs transmits gravity loads to the structural walls.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** In some cases, rubble stone and massive stone walls have been used.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 1-2%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 4-5%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** Typical wall densities for each horizontal direction are 2% and 7%, respectively.

**Wall Openings:** A typical house has 6 to 10 windows per floor, with a total average size of 3.0 sq m. The position of these openings is variable, but usually is approximately 0.8 to 1.0 m from the floor level in rooms and from 1.8 to 2.0 m in bathrooms.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** Commonly, owners build interior walls or additional floors for new rooms.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone isolated footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** In buildings close to rivers, fieldstone strip footing can be found.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** 

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerArchitect

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Engineers are in charge of the structural design and construction process. Architects are in charge of the architectural design and could be in charge of the construction process.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** Both, the structural and the construction engineer will have five years of study and minimum work experience of two years.

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Contractor

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** It is typically built by developers.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** 

**Construction process and phasing:** Masonry walls are built with serrated edges, and then the tie-columns are cast against them. After that, bond beams, lintels and floors are built simultaneously. Concrete is mixed in machine mixers and taken with wheelbarrows to fill the wood formwork. Tools and equipment used are: hammers, spatulas, wheelbarrows, concrete vibrator and concrete mixers. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size. Buildings are originally designed for a specific number of stories. However, it is common that owners decide to build additional floors some years later.

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** Seismic Design Standards E-030. 1977 National Construction Standards, Masonry Standards E-070 1998

**Process for building code enforcement:** Municipal authorities approve the structural and architectural design for the building. It is a common practice that owners retain a building supervisor to oversee the construction process. In order to start the construction, it is necessary to get a building permit. Municipal authorities are in charge of giving this permit to builder companies. Each project must have four types of technical drawings: structural drawings, architectural drawings, hydraulic installation drawings, and power installation drawings. Municipal authorities need to approve this technical information to issue a building permit.

Exterior walls (2 layers); one layer is made using regular concrete and the other one is made of lightwight concrete (for the purpose of heat insulation). 3. Interior walls are made of regular concrete.
