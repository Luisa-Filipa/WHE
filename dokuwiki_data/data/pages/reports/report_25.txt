**Country:** Iran

**Author(s):** Arzhang Alimoradi

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Iran. In general, this housing type constitutes 30 to 40% of urban construction types in most of the Iranian cities. However, in northern provinces (Golestan, Mazandaran, Gilan) and in the areas close to the central desert of Iran, (Khorasan, Yazd, and Sistan-va-Baloochestan) this ratio is lower (around 20 to 35%). This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas. This system of construction is not obviously the first choice for low-income families living in the villages but it's more widely spread in the cities where material and workmanship can be found cheaper.

**Summary:** This is a common type of urban/rural construction in many parts of Iran. It is widely used in the cities as a popular structural system for low-rise residential buildings because of ease of construction and erection of the frames. Buildings of this type are up to 5 stories high, with height/width aspect ratio on the order of 1.5. This system consists of a special kind of steel framing with heavy brick infills as partitions. Roof girders are connected to the supporting columns by means of semi-rigid connections. Diaphragms may range from flexible to rigid depending on the detailings and the construction quality. The structure is extremely heavy because of the brick infills between the roof beams. Roof is constructed in the form of a shallow arch called jack arch. Roofs, ceilings, and floors constructed in this way contributed to building failures and to an unusually high death toll in many recent earthquakes in Iran. As many as half the buildings completed in the early 1970s in Iran had jack arches. In a jack arch system, steel beams or a reinforced concrete joist system span the distance between the main girders across the length of the building. An arch made of small bricks connect the beams. Each arch has a rise of only about ten centimeters. The "valleys" of this wave-like surface are filled with mortar. The completed ceiling, roof, or floor is thick and heavy. Frequently the steel support beams are not tied together properly or are left untied (From: http://www.johnmartin.com/eqshow/647014_00.htm). Seismic vulnerability of this system is observed as medium to high. The dynamic behavior of the system in the two main perpendicular directions of the building plan differs significantly because of the differences in the stiffness and configuration of the connections in these two directions. Furthermore, "X" bracings are usually used in the weak direction which futher magnifies the non-uniform behaviour of the structural system.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Buildings of this type are generally of rectangular shape, however there are also cases of irregularities in plan and height. (Figure 19)

**Typical plan length (meters):** 12-20

**Typical plan width (meters):** 9-15

**Typical story height (meters):** 3

**Type of Structural System:** Steel: Moment Resisting Frame: With brick masonry partitions

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical and lateral load-resisting system is steel moment resisting frame. Consists of Steel frames (girders and columns with semi-rigid connections). 1- Light bracing, L or T sections, most of the times in one direction of the building only (perpendicular to street) where the building does not have any openings and hence connected to the adjacent building. 2- On the other sides, lateral forces are resisted by means of semi-rigid connections #Khorjini# (Figures 3, 4 and 5). 3- Also un-reinforced brick infills between frame panels (without any gap) may contribute to the lateral force resistance but usually during seismic analysis and design process their effects are ignored and the R factor (inelastic reduction factor of seismic coefficient) is rather chosen based on the bare steel frame (as a common mistake). According to the Iranian National Building Code, steel bracing should be provided in both directions of the building.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** As mentioned before, buildings of this type have X bracing in one direction (perpendicular to the street) and semi-rigid connections in the other direction.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 4-5%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 4-5%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 5%. 4%.

**Wall Openings:** In most of the cases openings are only in two parallel sides of the building plan as in the other two sides the building is standing side by side by the neighboring structure. X bracings are provided in the closed sides.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** Yes

**Modifications of buildings:** Adding stories on the top of the building, removing the partition walls.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** Seismic problems related to the foundation system are rare. Single footings are connected to each other by strong ties.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Masonry and steel jack arch structure; Roofs/floors are very heavy and behave as flexible diaphragm unless special detailing is considered. The system consists of parallel roof steel beams at about one meter distance; beams support the shallow brick arches which are covered and leveled by gypsum finishing.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Masonry and steel jack arch structure; Roofs/floors are very heavy and behave as flexible diaphragm unless special detailing is considered. The system consists of parallel roof steel beams at about one meter distance; beams support the shallow brick arches which are covered and leveled by gypsum finishing.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerOther

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Usually the whole process of construction is being done by a team of workers (not always certified workers). A registered engineer checks the final design.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** In spite of many lessons learnt in the previous earthquakes proving poor performance of this structural system, many engineers still design the buildings using this system. Lack of quality control by the engineers during design and construction is obvious.

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** These days it is typically designed and built by the developers.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** 

**Construction process and phasing:** In most of the cases, owner or a contractor on behalf is in charge of the construction. The construction process has 3 main parts, excavation and foundation construction, steel frames erection, masonry works and the installation of electrical and mechanical systems. Simple machinery is used throughout the construction like a small crane. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size.

**Construction issues:** The main issue which causes problems during dynamic behavior is associated with the modelling of the "Khorjini" connections (girder to columns). Also lack of precise detailing at design stage contributes to some careless construction practices of the system.

----

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** #Iranian Code of Practice For Seismic Resistance Design of Buildings, 2nd Edition 1999, Iranian National Building Code"; special detailing required to improved the seismic performance are addressed in the appendix. The first code/standard addressing this type of construction was issued in 1999.

**Process for building code enforcement:** The new edition of the #Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings-Standard No. 2800#, which is a very well prepared code, was subjected to the Iranian government approval in December 1999. However there are not much strong interest among building officials towards the enforcement of the code and and quality control of the constructed infrastructures in many parts of the country is low. "In general the building departments of municipalities have the responsibility to check and approve the design process, however the design engineer holds the responsibility for the projects. When the construction is completed then the municipal authorities check the finished project to issue the occupancy permit." (Ref: www.johnmartin.com/EERI).
