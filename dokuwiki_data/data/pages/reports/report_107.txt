==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 107

**Building Type:** Reinforced Adobe

**Country:** Peru

**Author(s):** Daniel Quiun

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the following areas of Peru: Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Ica, Trujillo, Huaraz and Cuzco. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural, sub-urban and urban areas. Some small towns may be considered as urban areas.

**Summary:** This is a reinforcement system for existing adobe houses, as well as an adaptation for new adobe houses, with the objective to prevent their collapse under severe earthquakes. An extensive experimental research project was developed between 1994 and 1999, with the financial support of GTZ of Germany, the administration of CERESIS, and the execution of the Catholic University of Peru (PUCP). Several reinforcement techniques were studied, and itwas concluded that the most appropriate was to reinforce the walls with horizontal and vertical strips of wire mesh electrically welded, covered with mortar. The technique was applied in 1998 as pilot projects in 20 houses in 6 cities in Peru. Later in 1999-2000 it was extended to Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador and Venezuela. We had to wait for an earthquake to assess the effectiveness of the reinforcement. In the earthquake of June 23, 2001 (Mw=8.4), that affected the south of Peru, six reinforced adobe houses had no damage. Neighboring dwellings of unreinforced adobe suffered heavy damage or collapsed. This success motivated several reconstruction programs of new reinforced adobe houses in the Andean zone, in which the technique was improved and applied in more than 500 houses, which are described herein. Shaking table tests on the system used in the new houses at the Structures Laboratory of PUCP demonstrated that the reinforcement provided is effective for resisting severe earthquakes without collapse. The August 15, 2007 Pisco earthquake (Mw8.0), 200 km south of Lima, also provoked the collapse of many traditional adobe houses. In Ica province, 5 houses were reinforced in 1998 using the wire mesh strips, and all withstand the earthquake undamaged.

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 9-9.6

**Typical plan width (meters):** 6-6.4

**Typical story height (meters):** 3

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Mud walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls. Gravity loads are resisted by reinforced adobe walls. In fact, the technique of reinforcement does not improve the gravity load-resisting system substantially. The lateral load-resisting system is earthen walls. Adobe walls are reinforced with strips of electrically welded wire mesh attached to the adobe wall by nails, and covered with cement mortar. A reinforced concrete collar beam is used on top of all walls

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** The structural system simulates a confined masonry system with vertical strips of cement plastered welded steel mesh as columns and identical horizontal strips as beams. The purpose of those strips is to resist the forces produced by the earthquake.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 10-15%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 10-15%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 20 %. Usually it is in the range of 10% - 14%.

**Wall Openings:** There is one main door with a window, and central windows in other walls.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** The idea is that the 36 m2 module can be replicated in the remainder free area of the property.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** Rubble concrete strip footings are also used. The stones are up to 8 inches size. Some 4 inch stones should be attached on the upper base of the foundation for providing connectivity with the walls.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** A floor on the ground. These are single storey houses with no suspended floors. Photos are included. Adobe houses described here are single storey.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Wood planks or beams that support slate, metal, asbestos-cement or plastic corrugated sheets or tiles

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 0.8 meters. A typical house has two rooms, with 36 square meters of plan area. Each room has 3.2m sides, and 2.2m height at the lowest part to 3.0m at the highest part. The thickness of the wall is 0.4m and the roof has a small slope. There is one main door with a window, and central windows in other walls.

==== 3. Buildings Process ====

=== Description of Building Materials===

^ Structural Element ^ Building Material (s) ^ Comment (s) ^
| Wall/Frame | Adobe | The axial compressive strength is 0.8 MPa or less. The material has a poor shear strength, which is the reason why it needs to be reinforced. Adobe is a mixing among soil, water and straw . The proportion between mud and straw is 5 :1. The purpose of straw is to prevent the adobe from cracking. Adobe units size: 400mmx400mmx100 mm In some parts of the country, additional materials are added for making adobe. | 
| Foundations | Rubble concrete | Rubble concrete has a moderate strength for axial loads. Cement:coarse sand 1:10 plus 40% of stones (6"maximum size). The coarse sand and stones must be carefully chosen to avoid premature failures. | 
| Floors |  |  | 
| Roof | The house has roof beams made of wooden logs. |  |

=== Construction Process ===

**Who typically builds this construction type?** OwnerMason

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** These houses are built by trained masons with the aid of the owners.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** A mason with experience of mixing and placing mortar is required.

**Construction process and phasing:** The procedure is similar to plain masonry houses, from foundations until roof. First, a rubble strip foundation is done following the former specifications. Then, stem walls are built over the foundation. Adobe units are placed with mud mortar to build the walls, according to former described procedures. Connector wires are left inside the mortar joints (these ones with cement mortar). Then, the corners are reinforced with welded mesh strips, which are nailed to the adobe walls. Hereafter, a collar concrete reinforced beam is built around the top of all walls. Finally it is time to make the sloped roof. For this purpose, wood beams are used and finally the roof is made of metal sheets or clay looking sheets. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size. In the case of existing adobe construction of the reinforcement is designed. The places to put the mesh strips are carefully determined.

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** National Building Code in Peru issued in 2006 includes a special chapter on adobe (called Norma E.080 in Spanish).Among the recommended reinforcement systems, the use of wire meshes are specified.

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** Yes, in rural areas of Arequipa and Moquegua regions after the 2001 earthquake (more than 500 house units).

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?:** New housing units were constructed after the destruction caused by the 2001 earthquake.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** Yes, 2 PUCP professors visited the rural areas in 2003 for one week.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** The project by GTZ-COPASA-SENCICO provided technical assistance and the owner/user provided low quality handwork.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?** In 1998, six similar existing adobe houses were retrofitted (in Moquegua and Tacna regions), and withstood the M8.4 2001 earthquake undamaged. Later, five similar existing adobe houses were retrofitted in Ica region, and withstood the M8.0 2007 Pisco earthquake undamaged.
