**Country:** Syria

**Author(s):** Adel Awad, Hwaija Bassam, Isreb Talal

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in the main cities of Syria like Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Homs, Hama, Deir-ez zor, Idleb, Al-Haskeh, Al-Raka, Al-Sweida, Dara, Tartus, Jableh, Qunitera etc. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** These buildings are found in the main cities of Syria and represent modern construction practice followed in the last 50 years. The floor system is a two-way reinforced concrete slab, which spans between orthogonal sets of beams that transfer the load to the columns. The frames are designed to carry gravity loads only.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** Data about the earthquakes, starting from 18th century up to date, were taken from Ambraseys (1983). However, we have developed the estimate of the magnitude (M) and the maximum MMI intensity based on our findings and experience. Most of the buildings destroyed in the past earthquakes were of adobe and stone masonry, particularly in the urban areas.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.
