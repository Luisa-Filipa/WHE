==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Number of stories: GPS5-4: 4-5, GPS2: 2GPSM: 3-4

**Typical plan length (meters):** 

**Typical plan width (meters):** 

**Typical story height (meters):** 

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Large panel precast walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** Gravity load-bearing structure consists of precast RC wall panels and precast RC floor slabs.The lateral load-resisting system consists of precast RC panels acting as shear walls; all walls and floor slabs are combined together, thus creating a rigid structure through a special joint system; horizontal and vertical steel dowels are provided in walls and floor slabs; once the panels are erected in their final position, the dowels are welded, and the gaps between the panels are filled with cast-in-situ concrete; shear stresses in the joints are supported by shear keys.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** Precast concrete walls with monolithic panel joints

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** >20%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** >20%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** 

**Wall Openings:** 

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** 

**Modifications of buildings:** 

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Mat foundation

**Additional comments on foundation:** Shallow foundation; mat foundation under the panels (so-called sockets) provide stiffness to the system.

**Type of Floor System:** Precast concrete floor with reinforced concrete topping

**Additional comments on floor system:** Precast RC solid slab considered to be a rigid diaphragm

**Type of Roof System:** Precast concrete roof with reinforced concrete topping

**Additional comments on roof system:** Precast RC solid slab considered to be a rigid diaphragm

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

The main reference publication used in developing the statements used in this table is FEMA 310 “Handbook for the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings-A Pre-standard”, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, D.C., 1998.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.

^Structural/Architectural Feature ^ Statement ^ Seismic Resistance^
| Lateral load path | The structure contains a complete load path for seismic force effects from any horizontal direction that serves to transfer inertial forces from the building to the foundation. |  |
| Building Configuration-Vertical | The building is regular with regards to the elevation. (Specify in 5.4.1) |  |
| Building Configuration-Horizontal | The building is regular with regards to the plan. (Specify in 5.4.2) |  |
| Roof Construction | The roof diaphragm is considered to be rigid and it is expected that the roof structure will maintain its integrity, i.e. shape and form, during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. |  |
| Floor Construction | The floor diaphragm(s) are considered to be rigid and it is expected that the floor structure(s) will maintain its integrity during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. |  |
| Foundation Performance | There is no evidence of excessive foundation movement (e.g. settlement) that would affect the integrity or performance of the structure in an earthquake. |  |
| Wall and Frame Structures-Redundancy | The number of lines of walls or frames in each principal direction is greater than or equal to 2. |  |
| Wall Proportions | Height-to-thickness ratio of the shear walls at each floor level is: Less than 25 (concrete walls); Less than 30 (reinforced masonry walls); Less than 13 (unreinforced masonry walls); |  |
| Foundation-Wall Connection | Vertical load-bearing elements (columns, walls) are attached to the foundations; concrete columns and walls are doweled into the foundation. |  |
| Wall-Roof Connections | Exterior walls are anchored for out-of-plane seismic effects at each diaphragm level with metal anchors or straps. |  |
| Wall Openings |  |  |
| Quality of Building Materials | Quality of building materials is considered to be adequate per the requirements of national codes and standards (an estimate). |  |
| Quality of Workmanship | Quality of workmanship (based on visual inspection of a few typical buildings) is considered to be good (per local construction standards). |  |
| Maintenance | Buildings of this type are generally well maintained and there are no visible signs of deterioration of building elements (concrete, steel, timber). |  |
