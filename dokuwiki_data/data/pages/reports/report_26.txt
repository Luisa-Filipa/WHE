**Report:** 26

**Building Type:** Semi-rigid steel frame with "Khorjinee" connections

**Country:** Islamic Republic of Iran

**Author(s):** Behrokh Hosseini Hashemi, Mohsen Ghafory Ashtiany

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in urban and in some rural areas of Iran, especially in less humid regions. The percentage of this housing type in those regions is almost 70% of steel buildings. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.

**Summary:** This housing type is commonly used for low-rise building construction in Iran, mainly for family apartment buildings. This structure is characterized with a special type of semi-rigid beam-to- column connection called #Khorjinee connection#. This connection consists of a pair of continuous beams spanning over several columns and connected to the column sides by means of angle sections. Beam and column are welded to the angle section. One of the major problems with the khorjinee connections is that it is very difficult to improve the rigidity of the connection in the weak direction (the direction perpendicular to the connection) since the crossed beams are connected to the web of khorjinee beams. Thus in the weak direction of the frames the connections are considered as pinned (hinges) and the bracing is used to resist seismic loads. However, in the khorjinee direction, since the possibility of using the bracing is very limited, the frame is considered as a rigid structure. Also, out-of-plane partial beam-to-column transfer of bending moment and early onset of failure in the angles are the most likely cause of failure for a building subjected to lateral earthquake loads. These buildings are vulnerable in earthquakes (e.g. 1990 Manjil earthquake).

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 5-9 units

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 12-20

**Typical plan width (meters):** 9-15

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.7

**Type of Structural System:** Steel: Braced Frame: Concentric connections in all panels

**Additional comments on structural system:** In both directions of the building the lateral load-resisting system should be provided by steel bracing (according to seismic code of Iran). However in most of these buildings, the steel bracing system is only used in one direction (the direction which is perpendicular to the street). The other direction (which is usually parallel to street), due to the existence of large opening in the wall of this direction, does not have any lateral resisting system. Gravity loads are sustained by steel frames.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 0-1%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 0-1%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is 0.1.

**Wall Openings:** To view outside the building, typically a large window opening is in the transverse direction of the building. This window almost takes 70% of the external wall area. The other wall has one or two doors or windows opening. The door sizes are typically 90 X 210 (cm) and the other window sizes are 160 X 90 (cm). The overall window and door areas are about 35% of the overall wall surface area.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** Adding stories on the top of the building, removing the partition walls.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footingShallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** Seismic problems related to the foundation system are rare. Single footings are connected to each other by strong ties.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Concrete joists with infilled hollow blocks topped with concrete slab. The floor and roof are considered to be rigid diaphragm.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Concrete joists with infilled hollow blocks topped with concrete slab. The floor and roof are considered to be rigid diaphragm.

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is several meters.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerBuilder

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** For design of building, engineers and architectures are both involved. However, in most projects, during the construction process they do not spend any remarkable time to visit the site.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** As far as the member sizes and foundations design concern, engineers are expert enough to design this type of building. In most projects engineers do not address any detail of the connection and they leave this part of job to experienced builders.

----

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** It is typically built by developers or for speculation.

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** 

**Construction process and phasing:** Typically developers build these types of constructions. Process starts with the foundations and fixing base plates on them. Then erection of steel frame and placing of joists and blocks, purring the concrete topping and then working out the infill walls and finally putting the finishing on the hole building. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.

**Construction issues:** The main problems are associated with the construction process. In most projects, designers do not provide any detail for the connections and this responsibility is left to experienced builders, who have no knowledge about the better performance of the connections in the case of earthquake happens.

----

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** The first official issue about this type of building was in 1999. The Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings (Standard 2800) in its 2nd revised edition (1999) addressed this type of construction to be considered as a Type 2 construction (i.e. simple framing in both directions). Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Building, 2nd Edition-1999 Iranian National Building Code, Part: 10, Steel Structures, 1994

**Process for building code enforcement:** The building department of municipalities approves the design and holds the designer responsible for the projects. After finishing the construction the municipal authorities check the finished project and issue occupancy permit stage. However, most of these controls are the subjects of the architectural views.
