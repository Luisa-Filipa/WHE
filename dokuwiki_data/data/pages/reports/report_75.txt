==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 75

**Building Type:** Stone masonry apartment building

**Country:** Algeria

**Author(s):** Mohammed Farsi, Farah Lazzali, Yamina Ait-Mziane

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** These stone masonry buildings exist throughout northern Algeria. In particular, the multi-story buildings exist mainly in the major cities e.g. Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Annaba, etc. This construction type may constitute 40 to 50% of the urban housing stock.

**Summary:** Stone masonry building is typical multy-family residential construction found in most Algerian urban centres, and it constitutes 40 to 50% of the total urban housing stock. This construction, mostly built before 1950s by French contractors, is no longer practiced. Buildings of this type are typically 4 to 6 stories high. The slabs are wooden structures or shallow arches supported by steel beams (jack arch system). Stone masonry walls, usually 400 to 600 mm thick, have adequate gravity load-bearing capacity, however their lateral load resistance is very low. As a result, these buildings are considered to be highly vulnerable to seismic effects.

**Length of time practiced:** 101-200 years

**Still Practiced:** No

**In practice as of:** 1950

**Building Occupancy:** Mixed residential/commercial

**Typical number of stories:** 5

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** Typically

**Comments:** This construction was practiced prior to 1950 by French contractors.It is the same construction type found in countries around

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Square, solidSquare, with an opening in planRectangular, solidRectangular, with an opening in planL-shapeTriangular, with an opening in planE-shapeU- or C-shapeIrregular plan shape

**Additional comments on plan shape:** The building plan for this housing type can be of different forms: rectangular, L-shaped, U-shaped, etc. (see photos 1 and 2)

**Typical plan length (meters):** 25

**Typical plan width (meters):** 15

**Typical story height (meters):** 3.5

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Massive stone masonry (in lime/cement mortar)

**Additional comments on structural system:** Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system consists of the stone masonry walls built in longitudinal and cross directions. Wall thickness varies from 400 to 600 mm. Low-strength mortar (either cement/sand or mud mortar) has been used. According to the Algerian Seismic Code (RPA99), this construction is permitted only if confined with reinforced concrete ties in vertical and horizontal direction, and with RC slabs used as floor and roof structures. The maximum building height allowed by the Code depends on the seismic zone (17 m, 14 m and 11 m, for seismic zones I, II and III, respectively).Gravity load-bearing system: Stone masonry walls are the principal elements of the gravity load-bearing structure.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** The predominant structural system is composed of load bearing external stone masonry walls and wooden floors slabs. Thick external walls are distributed in both directions, however interior non-structural walls are thin and used to partitioning the space. In some cases, varied structural units (adobe, brick and stone) and systems are used resulting in variable wall strength and stiffness. Photos 03 & 04

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 5-10%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 5-10%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The ratio of total wall area/plan area (for each floor) in each principal direction is between 5% and 6%.

**Wall Openings:** The number, size and position of openings for a typical floor in a building are shown on the typical plan (Figure 3). The total window and door area is about 25% of the overall wall surface area.Openings are categorized according to their construction period and method; in some of them wooden lintels are used and in others the top of the opening is closed with a small vault.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** Modifications are often undertaken by the residents without any professional assistance provided by engineers. They include demolition of interior walls, opening commercial areas, and vertical extensions.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** 

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Floor: vaulted masonry (bricks) supported by steel beams Floor and roof structures are not considered as rigid diaphragms.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Timber: wood planks or beams that support clay tiles Floor and roof structures are not considered as rigid diaphragms.Photo 03

**Additional comments section 2:** Typical separation distance between buildings: 4-6 meters

=== Seismic Vulnerability Rating ===

For information about how seismic vulnerability ratings were selected see the {{ :wiki:seismic_vulnerability_rating.pdf | Seismic Vulnerability Guidelines}}

|   ^  High vulnerabilty      ^^  Medium vulnerability      ^^  Low vulnerability      ^^
|   | A                   | B  | C                      | D  | E                   | F  |
| Seismic vulnerability class   | o | | | | | |

**Additional comments section 5:** Behavior of masonry buildings when subjected to seismic event is depending on how the walls and the floors are interconnected and anchored. In the majority of observed masonry buildings where the timber joist is not anchored to the masonry, walls tend to separate along their intersections causing vertical cracks.

==== 6. Retrofit Information ====

=== Description of Seismic Strengthening Provisions ===

^ Structural Deficiency ^ Seismic Strengthening ^
| Cracks in the stone masonry walls | - Cracks less than 0.3 mm width; by injection using fluid cement mortar- Large cracks: injection and adding stitching dog or steel bars; rebuilt using bricks or stones to bridge the crack zone in case of vertical crack; using metallic plate in case | 
| Lack of integrity | Addition of horizontal and vertical RC ties at exterior and steel ties in the interior, see Figure 7A |

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** 

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** These strengthening techniques were used to repair and strengthen the damaged buildings after the Algerian earthquakes reported in this contribution. A guide for using these seismic strengthening techniques is available in Algeria ("Mthodes de Rparation et de Renforcement des Ouvrages" was edited by CGS in 1992).

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** Vulnerability studies for strategic buildings were done in 1996 at Algiers City, and some buildings of this type were strengthened as a result of the study.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** No.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** A contractor performed the construction and engineers were involved.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?** Good.
