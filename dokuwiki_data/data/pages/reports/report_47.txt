**Building Type:** Traditional oval-shaped rural stone house

**Country:** Nepal

**Author(s):** Yogeshwar Krishna Parajuli, Jitendra Kumar Bothara, Bijay Kumar Upadhyay

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in in Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, and Baglung districts of Central Mid Mountains of the Western Development Region of Nepal (Nepal is divided into five development regions and seventy five districts which are further subdivided into small political units (56 municipalities and some 4000 Village Development Committees). The percentage of this building type in the total stock as well as total population inhibiting this building type is unknown. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas. These buildings are being gradually replaced by more modern building types even in rural areas.

**Summary:** This is a typical rural construction concentrated in the central mid-mountain region, particularly in the Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, and Baglung districts. (The country is divided into 75 administrative districts.) These primarily residential buildings are basically loose-fitting, load-bearing structures, constructed of uncoursed rubble stone masonry walls and a timber structure for the floor and roof. Village artisans play a pivotal role in these owner-builtbuildings. Because of the loss of integrity during an event, they are expected to be extremely vulnerable from the effects of an earthquake.

**Length of time practiced:** More than 200 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**In practice as of:** 

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 2

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** Typically

==== 2. Features ====

**Plan Shape:** Other

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Building plan is oval in shape.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 10

**Typical plan width (meters):** 8

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.2

**Type of Structural System:** Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is stone masonry walls. The gravity loads of the main building are carried by load bearing walls. Floor and roof are constructed of timber, which transfers their loads to the walls (typical thickness 450 mm - 600 mm), which carries the load to the foundation. These walls are carried by a strip foundation of uncoursed rubble stone masonry. The veranda (annex to the main building) is a lean-to structure to main building, which is supported by timber posts at one end. These posts are generally supported by an above-ground stone pedestal (no anchorage between stone and post). No rigid connection is made between column and beam being supported. The lateral load-resisting system is stone masonry walls. The load bearing walls carry the lateral loads. The masonry walls thus act as shear walls. The building has only a perimeter wall, which encloses the building space and also carries the loads. The roof and floor are loose fit timber structures, which act as flexible diaphragm and are not able to transfer the lateral load to wall piers according to their stiffness.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** Length varies from 8 to 10 meters. Width varies from 6 to 8 meters. Typical story height is 2 - 2.2 meters. Span between the supports of floor and walls ranges from 1.5 to 2 meters usually. The building is oval shaped and there does not exist any internal walls for separating internal space, so the concept of span is not applicable.

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** >20%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** >20%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** Total wall density (total plan area of wall/ total plinth area) is around 25%.

**Wall Openings:** Typically three to four openings are provided in each story, one for door and rest for windows in main building. Front facade has more openings than the back. Openings are limited in size. Openings constitute some 15-20% of total wall length. Spacing between openings is generally more than twice the length of opening.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** There aren't modifications of bearing structures in these buildings usually.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing

**Additional comments on foundation:** 

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Wood planks (or fire wood) and joists covered with thick mud overlay. Floor and roof structures are loose-fit elements, as if one component is stacked over the other (without any nailing). These therefore behave as flexible diaphragm. In past earthquakes such floors were just scattered due to shaking.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Timber: thatched roof supported on wood purlins; wood shingle roof Floor and roof structures are loose-fit elements, as if one component is stacked over the other (without any nailing). These therefore behave as flexible diaphragm. In past earthquakes such floors were just scattered due to shaking.

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 10 meters.

=== Design Process === 

**Who is involved with the design process?** OtherNone of the above

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** 

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** Engineers /architects / technicians are not involved in this construction type.

----

=== Construction Process === 

**Who typically builds this construction type?** OwnerOther

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** Builders/ owners live in this construction type (house owner himself is part of construction team).

**Expertise of those involved in building process:** The artisans are without any formal training. The construction know-how is transferred from generation to generation or the people learn the process on site in a very informal way. The head mason s skilled but the level of know-how varies from person to person. No standard or minimum requirement exists for head or any other mason. The rest of the working team is composed of semi or unskilled personnel.

**Construction process and phasing:** The walls are constructed in a random uncoursed manner by using irregular stones bound with mud mortar. The stones are collected from quarries, riverbed or field, sometimes partially dressed. Space between interior and exterior wythes is filled with small stones and mud. The joists and rafters are just placed on walls without any anchorage or connection. These buildings are owner-built where village artisans play pivotal role. Simple tools such as chisels, hammers, saw etc are used for construction. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.

=== Building Codes and Standards === 

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** NBC203 : Guidelines for Earthquake Resistant Building Construction: Low Strength Masonry (Draft)

**Process for building code enforcement:** There is no process for Building Code enforcement in rural areas (Village Development Committee areas) of Nepal.

----

=== Building Permits and Development Control Rules === 

**Are building permits required?** No

**Is this typically informal construction?** Yes

**Is this construction typically authorized as per development control rules?** No

**Additional comments on building permits and development control rules:** The building by-laws, building permit process and building construction controlling monitoring mechanisms only exists in municipalities and not in Village Development Committee (local authority at village level- rural areas). This is basically a rural house type where the building permit process does not exist. If this type of housing were to be constructed in a municipality, it would have to pass through the formal process (but the process does not require approval of structural drawings for this size of building). Present bylaws or regulation do not prohibit the construction of this type of building in municipal areas.
