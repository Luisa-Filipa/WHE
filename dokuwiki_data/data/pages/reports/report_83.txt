==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 83

**Building Type:** Precast concrete panel apartment buildings

**Country:** Romania

**Author(s):** Maria Bostenaru Dan, Ilie Sandu

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all major urban areas in the country. This type of housingconstruction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** This multi-family urban housing construction waspracticed in Romania between the 1960s and1990s. The load-bearing system is a precastreinforced concrete large panel construction.Buildings of this type are typically highrises (10or 11 stories high), although there are also lowtomedium-rise buildings (4 to 8 stories high) ofthis construction type (with different structuraldetails). In general, buildings of this type are ofrectangular plan, with honeycomb ("fagure")layout, housing typically four apartments perfloor. Wall panels are laid in both the longitudinaland the transverse direction. The panels aremechanically coupled at the base, withcontinuous vertical reinforcement bars.This region is well known as a seismically pronearea, with the epicentre of damagingearthquakes close to Vrancea. Earthquakes withthe Richter magnitude of over 7.0 occur onaverage every 30 years. Bucharest, the capital,is located around 150 km south of the epicentreand lies in the main direction of the propagationof seismic waves. The Bucharest area is locatedon the banks of the Dmbovita and Colentinarivers, on nonhomogenous alluvial soil deposits.During the earthquake of 4 March 1977 (Richtermagnitude 7.2), over 30 buildings collapsed inBucharest, killing 1,424 people. There was nosignificant damage reported to the buildings ofthis construction type in the 1977 earthquake.Consequently, this construction technique hascontinued to be practiced since the earthquake.The building described in this report was builtafter the 1977 earthquake, and has not beenexposed to damaging earthquakes so far.

**Length of time practiced:** Less than 25 years

**Still Practiced:** No

**In practice as of:** 1990

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 50+ units

**Typical number of stories:** 4-11

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Comments:** This construction was practiced between 1960 and 1990. In the Bucharest area,buildings of this type were initially built in 1959

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 25-125

**Typical plan width (meters):** 25-125

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.6

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Shear wall structure with precast wall panel structure

**Additional comments on structural system:** This building type is characterized by a so-called "honeycomb" ("fagure" in Romanian) building plancharacteristic for Romanian housing design - the same system is described for the "OD" housing type(World Housing Encyclopedia Report 78). It consists of box-type units creating rooms. Due to such abuilding configuration, the walls are well connected and are able to carry the loads in a uniform manner.Floor structures are 120 mm thick reinforced concrete solid slabs supported by the loadbearing walls.Typical wall-floor connection is illustrated in Figure 13. These buildings are supported by mat foundations.The basement walls are cast-in-place.The special feature of the building described in this report is that the facade walls are non-loadbearingstructures of lightweight block masonry construction. In some buildings of this construction type, precastconcrete wall panels are used as faade elements. The interior wall panels are of solid concreteconstruction - in this case, there is no need for a 3-layered panel section with thermal insulation in themiddle (typical for the faade wall panels).The load-bearing walls are laid in two principal directions, as illustrated in Figure 9. In general, there aretwo interior walls in the longitudinal direction and nine walls in the transverse direction; it should be notedthat four transverse walls are continuous over the building width, whereas the other five walls are shorter.In addition, there are lightweight concrete partition walls, some of which have been removed in buildingrenovations carried out by owners.The main lateral load-resisting structure consists of 200 mm precast reinforced concrete wall panelssupported by RC slabs (walls in pre-1977 buildings are typically 140 mm thick). The wall panels form abox of room size ("panouri mari"). The lateral stability is provided by the columns tied to the wall panels,as illustrated in an example of corner panels, see Figure 12. Boundary elements are used instead of thecolumns as "stiffening" elements at the exterior (as shown in Figure 10). According to NBS (1977), themechanical union of wall panels in the joints is achieved by means of splice bars welded to the transversereinforcement of adjacent panels. Longitudinal bars, used singly in vertical joints and in pairs in horizontaljoints, provide an added bearing area for the transfer of tension across the connections. The coupling ofthe floor panels is somewhat different, as illustrated in Figure 15. The top bars are splice welded whilethe bottom bars are bent up 90 degrees and lapped. This particular scheme gives greater continuity to thefloors at the supports than the lapped loop arrangement used in the high-rise building system. The wallpanels are mechanically coupled at their base, as illustrated in Figure 16, so that all vertical bars arecontinuous across the horizontal joints (it should be noted that in the case of the high-rise building panelconnections only the longitudinal bars of vertical joints are coupled).

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 5-10%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 5-10%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typicalstructural wall density is 5% - 7% Wall density is larger in the transverse direction.

**Wall Openings:** There are between 20 and 30 windows per floor. Each room has one window and one door, except forthe corridors (larger number of doors). Windows constitute around 25% of the exterior wall area, whereasdoors constitute less than 15% of the interior wall area.

In some cases, those wereexisting cracks that were widened inthe 1977 earthquake. However, in thecity of Lasi (north of the epicentre), 45cracks developed in the walls especiallyabove the openings and around thestaircases in some 8-storey buildingsbuilt around 1960.
