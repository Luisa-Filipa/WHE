==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 1

**Report Date:** 

**Country:** Argentina

**Building Type:** Confined block masonry house

**Author(s):** Virginia I Rodriguez, Maria I Yacante, Sergio Reiloba

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in San Juan Capital City and the surroundings. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.

**Summary:** This is typically a one-or-two-story residential building, of detached or semi-detached construction, generally found in the urban areas of San Juan and Mendoza and less frequently in the rural areas. The walls are made of concrete block masonry with reinforced concrete columns and beams that tie the walls together and provide the strength for the building. One of the main structural deficiencies for this construction type lies in the widely different wall densities in the two orthogonal directions. This deficiency may be eliminated with appropriat architectural design. This construction type is otherwise expected to demonstrate good seismic performance. 

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years 

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**Building Occupancy:** Single dwelling

**Typical number of stories:** 1 or 2

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** 3

**Comments:** This construction practice has been followed for 30 years.

**Type of Structural System:** Other

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. It consists of concrete block masonry walls with reinforced concrete beams and columns. In some cases, concrete beams and columns are provided without the masonry walls, in which case this system behaves as a
frame; this depends on the architectural design. The lateral load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. It consists of concrete block masonry walls with reinforced concrete beams and columns.

=== Design Process ===

**Who is involved with the design process?** EngineerArchitect

**Roles of those involved in the design process:** Architects are in charge of the architectural design of the building and sometimes, the construction process. Engineers are in charge of the structural design and of the construction process in general.

**Expertise of those involved in the design process:** The professionals involved in the design and construction process -architects and engineers- have a good level of expertise and great experience in this type of construction, typical in San Juan.
----

=== Construction Process ===

**Who typically builds this construction type?** Other 

**Roles of those involved in the building process:** The builder usually does not live in this construction type. It is designed and built by professionals and used in housing plans developed and financed by the state.

**Construction process and phasing:** The construction process is usually carried out by a construction company. It begins with the filling in of foundations, the assembling of the bottom reinforced
concrete beams and columns and the casting of these beams. Then the block masonry walls are being built and the concrete columns are being cast. Subsequently, the top reinforced concrete beams are assembled and the slab concrete is poured. The tools and equipment typically used are. spatulas, shovels, hoes, baskets, saws, pliers, levels, cement mixers, etc. This type of construction is generally
designed for its final constructed size, but usually the final
size is fulfilled in a later stage, as an extension of the original construction. Sometimes the owner also builds additional parts, generally without any professional input.
