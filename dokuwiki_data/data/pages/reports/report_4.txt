==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 4

**Building Type:** Concrete shear walls buildings

**Country:** Chile

**Author(s):** Ofelia Moroni, Cristian Gomez

**Last Updated:**

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in all main cities of the country: Iquique, Antofagasta, Concepcion,Temuco, Valparaiso, Vina del Mar and Santiago. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urbanareas.

**Summary:** This housing type is mainly characterized by reinforced concrete shear walls that are built inboth directions along the entire height. Some of the walls may be perforated with openings(coupled walls). These buildings are multiple housing units and are found in the major urbanareas in Chile. Stiffness and mass distribution are regular and most of them may have asymmetry axis in at least one direction of the plan. In general, these buildings are quite stiffbecause they must resist a base shear of 5-6.7% (depending on the seismic zone) and the storydrift must be equal to or less than 0.002. Seismic performance is very good, strength andstiffness are controlled, and torsional effects are minimal. The buildings may have one or twobasement floors. Problems that may appear in the future include reduction in the wall density,introduction of soft floor, or torsional effects.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Yes

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 50+ units

**Typical number of stories:** 4-30

**Terrain-Flat:** Typically

**Terrain-Sloped:** Never

**Comments:** Typically from 4 to 30 stories, in recent years the average is 13 stories.It is not typical for the buildings of this type to ha

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** 

**Typical plan length (meters):** 20

**Typical plan width (meters):** 20

**Typical story height (meters):** 2.7

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Structural Wall: Moment frame with in-situ shear walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). Shear walls act as lateral as well asgravity load-bearing elements. Beams and slabs carry floor loads.The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). Shear walls provide adequatestrength and stiffness to control lateral displacements. In some cases, lintel beams couple some walls, thus resulting inthe reduced lateral displacements. If designed and detailed properly, those coupling beams dissipate energy whensubjected to severe earthquakes and are easily repaired after an earthquake.

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 3-4%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 3-4%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** For 95% of the buildings, the wall density is greater than 1.5% in each direction, average value = 2.8%Figures 6 and 7 show the variation on time of the wall density which has remain almost constant.

**Wall Openings:** Not Applicable. In this country there is no standardization for any element: window, door, etc, so it is not possible to provide an estimate of number or size of openings.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?** No

**Modifications of buildings:** The most popular may be infill balconies.

**Type of Foundation:** Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation

**Additional comments on foundation:** Strip footings are used in firm soil for middle height buildings (6-10 stories), but in softer soils or when there are basement for parking mat footings are used.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** Floor system(s): Structural concrete: post-tensioned slabs, cast in place solid slabs, precast solid slabs The floors and the roof are considered rigid in seismic analysis. Post-tensioned slab are used less often than cast inplace, but there are some buildings designed by important engineers firm that do have it. VSL has an office in Chileand they are trying to introduce it.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** Roof system(s): Structural concrete: cast in place solid slabs, precast solid slabsThe floors and the roof are considered rigid in seismic analysis. Post-tensioned slab are used less often than cast inplace, but there are some buildings designed by important engineers firm that do have it. VSL has an office in Chileand they are trying to introduce it.

**Additional comments section 2:** According to NCH433.of96 the distance must be at least 1.5 cm or 0.002 x total height of the building. Inaddition there are some dispositions about the distance to the neighboring site or free space for parking. So, individualbuildings in a block may be separated up to 10 meters. TypicalPlan Dimensions: - Average area: 487 m2. - Typical Number of Stories: In recent years the average is 13 stories.

----

=== Building Codes and Standards===

**Is this construction type address by codes/standards?** Yes

**Applicable codes or standards:** NCh433.of96 Seismic Design of Buildings. Until 1993 the NCh433.of72 was in force. The last two numbers indicates the year since the code is in force. Provisionally dispositions to design this type of buildings existed since 1966.Applicable national building code, material codes and seismic code/standards: NCh433.of96, In addition, ACI318-95 is used for design reinforced concrete elements, with some exceptions: the minimum compressive strength is 16 MPa, confinements at wall end or diagonal bars in couple beam are rarely used and a reduced reinforcement cover is allowed. The appendix of the NCh433.of96 states that "the shear wall design doesn't need to follow dispositions 21.6.6.1 to 21.6.6.4 of ACI 318-95.The most recent code/standard addressing this construction type was issued 1996.

**Process for building code enforcement:** The building design must follow the NCh433.of96 code, although no one verifies. In case of damage an arbitrage process may take place at the court of justice.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** Not many buildings existed in southern Chile in 1960, the only damage cited in the literature is the hospital in Valdivia.In 1985 only one building partially collapsed in Santiago (Villa Olimpica) and one had to be demolished in Vina del Mar (El Faro de Renaca). Important damages occurred in 5 stories buildings (Canal Beagle) that were located on the top of a hill in Vina del Mar where important acceleration amplification have been measured. A few others buildings in Vina del Mar had some walls damaged and some others had non-structural damage. FIFURE 6 shows the Edificio Acapulco building in Vina del Mar, after the 1985 Llolleo earthquake. This building suffered some damage in lintels during 1971 earthquake, that was not properly repaired, so during 1985 new cracks appeared. 

**Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:** Overall damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this type of construction included small shear cracks on walls and in lintels.

=== Description of Seismic Strengthening Provisions ===

^ Structural Deficiency ^ Seismic Strengthening ^
| Lintels damage | Rebuilt the lintel or fixed with epoxy. |
| Shear cracks in walls | The wall is thickened with a new mesh or confined element are added at the extremes. |

----

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** This is not a common activity in Chile. Figures 9 and 10 show strengthening of earthquake damaged building shown on Figure 8. Columns have been added to the extreme of one wall.

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?:** No

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?:** Only after an earthquake some buildings have been repaired, when some constructive deficiencies appeared. Edificio Acapulco in Vina del Mar, suffered some damage in lintels during 1971 earthquake, that were not properly repaired, so during 1985 new cracks appeared. Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the Acapulco building after the 1985 earthquake and after repaired work was done.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?:** Probably not.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?:** A contractor and an engineer were involved hired by the owner/user.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?:** 

**Additional comments section 6:** No earthquakes have occurred in Central Chile since 1985.
