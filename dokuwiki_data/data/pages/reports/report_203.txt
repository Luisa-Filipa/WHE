**Report:** 203

**Building Type:** PC Large Panel Building (Large panel series 1-451LP)

**Country:** Armenia

**Author(s):** 

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** All big cities in Armenia. About 10% of Armenia's multi-apartment building stock are made of this construction typology.

**Summary:** This construction typology consists of "large panels" which are precast RC wall elements. There are three types of the 9-storey buildings, either with square or rectangular plan shapes. In addition, 4- and 5-story buildings can also be found. Construction of these buildings started in the 1970s until now.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** Off

**Building Occupancy:** Residential, 20-49 unitsResidential, 50+ units

**Typical number of stories:** 44319

**Terrain-Flat:** Off

**Terrain-Sloped:** Off

**Comments:** Construction type typically on flat terrain and occasionally on sloped (hilly) terrain.

=== Past Earthquakes ===

**Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:** The 1988 Earthquake with epicenter in Spitak, Armenia (Mw 6.9) affected this type of constructions.These buildings performed well during the 1988 Spitak earthquake. Only slight damages, mainly minor cracking at some panel joints, were reported.

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

The main reference publication used in developing the statements used in this table is FEMA 310 “Handbook for the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings-A Pre-standard”, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, D.C., 1998.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.

^Structural/Architectural Feature ^ Statement ^ Seismic Resistance^
| Lateral load path | The structure contains a complete load path for seismic force effects from any horizontal direction that serves to transfer inertial forces from the building to the foundation. | N/A |
| Building Configuration-Vertical | The building is regular with regards to the elevation. (Specify in 5.4.1) | N/A |
| Building Configuration-Horizontal | The building is regular with regards to the plan. (Specify in 5.4.2) | N/A |
| Roof Construction | The roof diaphragm is considered to be rigid and it is expected that the roof structure will maintain its integrity, i.e. shape and form, during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. | N/A |
| Floor Construction | The floor diaphragm(s) are considered to be rigid and it is expected that the floor structure(s) will maintain its integrity during an earthquake of intensity expected in this area. | N/A |
| Foundation Performance | There is no evidence of excessive foundation movement (e.g. settlement) that would affect the integrity or performance of the structure in an earthquake. | N/A |
| Wall and Frame Structures-Redundancy | The number of lines of walls or frames in each principal direction is greater than or equal to 2. | N/A |
| Wall Proportions | Height-to-thickness ratio of the shear walls at each floor level is: Less than 25 (concrete walls); Less than 30 (reinforced masonry walls); Less than 13 (unreinforced masonry walls); | N/A |
| Foundation-Wall Connection | Vertical load-bearing elements (columns, walls) are attached to the foundations; concrete columns and walls are doweled into the foundation. | N/A |
| Wall-Roof Connections | Exterior walls are anchored for out-of-plane seismic effects at each diaphragm level with metal anchors or straps. | N/A |
| Wall Openings |  | N/A |
| Quality of Building Materials | Quality of building materials is considered to be adequate per the requirements of national codes and standards (an estimate). | N/A |
| Quality of Workmanship | Quality of workmanship (based on visual inspection of a few typical buildings) is considered to be good (per local construction standards). | N/A |
| Maintenance | Buildings of this type are generally well maintained and there are no visible signs of deterioration of building elements (concrete, steel, timber). | N/A |
