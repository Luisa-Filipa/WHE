==== 1. General Information ====

**Report:** 30

**Building Type:** Single-family reinforced concrete frame with masonry infill walls house

**Country:** Italy

**Author(s):** Maurizio Leggeri, Giuseppe Lacava, Eugenio Viola

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in many cities throughout Italy. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas. This type of construction is also present in suburban areas.

**Summary:** This building type is commonly used for multifamily housing in urban areas of Italy and is particularly common in the region of Potenza (Basilicata). Prior to 1981, this region was not included in the official seismic zonation map of Italy, in spite of the historical evidence. However, after the major earthquake of November 1980, the entire Potenza province was recognized as a seismically prone area. Consequently, seismic considerations were not taken into account for in the building design projects predating the 1980 earthquake. The main load-bearing structure is reinforced concrete frame with masonry infill walls. Many buildings of this type were strengthened using the financial assistance provided by the government. The upgrade typically consists of installing new shear walls and L-shaped columns, and strengthening the foundation.

**Length of time practiced:** 25-60 years

**Still Practiced:** No

==== 2. Features ====

{{gallery>:reports:report_30?rp30_features_*.jpg&300x300&lightbox&crop | }}

**Plan Shape:** Rectangular, solid

**Additional comments on plan shape:** Typical shape of the building plan is rectangular.

**Typical plan length (meters):** 20-50

**Typical plan width (meters):** 12

**Typical story height (meters):** 3.5-4

**Type of Structural System:** Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Designed for gravity loads only, with URM infill walls

**Additional comments on structural system:** Gravity: Reinforced concrete frame. Lateral: Originally, the buildings were designed for gravity loads only. Unreinforced masonry infill walls exist as partitions (nonloadbearing elements). The strengthening was carried out after the November 1980 earthquake, in order to incorporate elements of lateral load-resisting system. The upgrade consists of installing new RC shear walls, L-shaped concrete columns and strengthening the foundation (using internal micropiles and external macropiles).

**Gravity load-bearing & lateral load-resisting systems:** 

**Typical wall densities in direction 1:** 4-5%

**Typical wall densities in direction 2:** 4-5%

**Additional comments on typical wall densities:** The typical structural wall density is up to 5 %. Approximately 0.05 (i.e. 5%).

**Wall Openings:** The size of door opening is 0.80 m width and 2.00 m height. In the new RC shear walls installed as a part of the upgrade, there is only 1 door opening per apartment. The ratio of door area/shear wall area is approximately 9%.

**Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:** No

**Modifications of buildings:** The structural upgrade did not modify the building function (the same housing features were preserved after the upgrade).

**Type of Foundation:** Deep Foundation: Reinforced concrete bearing piles

**Additional comments on foundation:** For all the buildings built before the 1980 earthquake, without any seismic features, the reinforcement of piles was limited to the first 2.50-3.00 m, for the anchorage to the plinths.Fortunately, foundation collapse was not reported due to very good soil conditions (overconsolidated clay) with resetting of bending moment.

**Type of Floor System:** Other floor system

**Additional comments on floor system:** The floor is considered to act as a rigid diaphragm.

**Type of Roof System:** Roof system, other

**Additional comments on roof system:** The floor is considered to act as a rigid diaphragm.

**Additional comments section 2:** When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 8-10 meters. Currently, this type of construction is not being built. This building type was common in the cities when the area was not officially in the seismic zone (pre-1980).

=== Description of Seismic Strengthening Provisions ===

^ Structural Deficiency ^ Seismic Strengthening ^
| Pile Foundations | Strengthening | 
| RC Columns | Strengthening | 
| Deficient Lateral Load-Resisting Capacity | Installation of new RC shear walls | 

----

**Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:** The initial phase of the seismic upgrade design included the evaluation of the existing building in order to identify seismic deficiencies. Dynamic analysis was performed using the Super ETABS software, and the natural periods of the structure for six different modes. After the strengthening design was performed, the new periods have been calculated, showing that the strengthened building is characterized with a significantly higher stiffness as compared to the original building. A chart showing the the variation of natural vibration periods for the same five-story building before and after the retrofit is illustrated in Figure 20 (corresponding to the building shown in Figures 1, 5 and 7). A similar chart is presented on Figure 21, corresponding to a four-story building shown in Figures 2 and 8.

**Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?** Yes. The strengthening has been performed in practice. This type of strengthening assures the protection of the building from seismic effects and improved dynamic response.

**Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?** Repair and retrofit after the earthquake.

**Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?** No.

**Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?** Contractor performed the construction and an engineer was involved.

**What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?** The performance of retrofitted building was excellent in the earthquakes of 1990/1991.
