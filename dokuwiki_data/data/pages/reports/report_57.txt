**Building Type:** Wood panel wall buildings (typical seria 181-115-77cm of #Giprolesprom#)

**Country:** Russia

**Author(s):** Mark Klyachko, Andrey Benin, Janna Bagdanova

**Last Updated:** 

**Regions Where Found:** Buildings of this construction type can be found in several seismically prone areas of Russia (including Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region) where this construction accounts for 5 to 100% of the housing stock. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.

**Summary:** This is a rural housing construction practice widespread in the Russian forest areas. Buildings of this type are common in seismically prone areas of Russia (Far East, Siberia, Baikal Lake Region). The load-bearing structure is made of wood panel walls. Buildings have timber roof and fieldstone or concrete strip foundations. Typical seria 181-115-77 cm of #Giprolesprom# for seismic regions is an example of this building type. Seismic resistance is relatively high, provided the quality of materials and the construction are satisfactory.

=== Structural and Architectural Features for Seismic Resistance ===

The main reference publication used in developing the statements used in this table is FEMA 310 “Handbook for the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings-A Pre-standard”, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, D.C., 1998.

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.
