<strong>Building Type:</strong> Reinforced concrete frame building with an independent vertical extension
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Greece

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in many suburbs of large cities and as apartment building in smaller cities with older houses with no provisions for vertical extension. This contribution describes a typical building located in the Central Greece (Thrakomakedones - suburb of Athens). This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is a typical residential construction found in the suburbs of large Greek cities and smaller towns. Buildings of this construction type are three-story high with a warehouse at the ground floor level and typically two apartments at the upper floor levels. The peculiarity of this building type is that it consists of two independent structures built over a period of 20 years. The lower two stories were constructed in 1960&#039;s as a reinforced concrete frame structure, without provisions for the vertical extension. In 1980&#039;s, the building was extended by building an additional floor atop the existing structure and expanded horizontally by building an independent elevator core and staircase. Columns and shear walls at the perimeter of the 1980 portion of the building were built on the separate footings, whereas the interior columns and shear walls were constructed by drilling the openings through the slabs of the 1960 portion in order to achieve continuity from the top floor downwards to the new foundations. Floor structure for the 1980 portion was constructed at an elevation 400 mm higher as compared to the roof level of the 1960 portion. The entire layout results in a tight connection of the new and the old structure. Due to the eccentric position of the channel-shaped elevator shaft, seismic response of this structure is characterized with significant torsional vibrations in the newer (1980&#039;s) portion, thus resulting in excessive lateral displacements in the 1960 structure. Some buildings of this type were damaged in the 1999 Athens earthquake and were strengthened after the earthquake.

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Designed with seismic effects, with URM infill walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). Reinforced concrete slabs on beams supported by columns and shear walls. The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. The main lateral load-resisting system consists of reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame with shear walls. The lower two stories were constructed in 1960&#039;s as a reinforced concrete frame structure, without any provisions for the vertical extension. The frame is infilled with unreinforced limestone masonry infill walls 400 mm thick. The column layout is quite regular and there are no shear walls in this portion (see gray-shaded column sections in Figure 2). The building was expanded in the 1980&#039;s by constructing an additional floor atop the existing structure with an independent elevator core (see Figures 2, 3 and 4). The columns and shear walls located at the perimeter of the 1980 portion were built on the separate footings, whereas the interior columns and shear walls were constructed by drilling the openings through the slabs of the 1960&#039;s portion in order to achieve continuity from the top floor down to the new foundations. Floor structure for the 1980 portion was constructed at an elevation 400 mm higher as compared to the roof level of the 1960 portion.The entire layout resulted in a tight embracement of the 1960 and 1980 portion of the building.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> The older (1960s) portion of the building is a RC frame with limestone masonry infill walls designed to seismic requirements of the current building code of the period. The newer (1980s) portion was designed with seismic provisions. The 1980 portion is a dual system - RC frame with shear walls.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is 0.06% - 0.08%.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Typical openings for reinforced concrete buildings: window and door widths range from 0.80 m to 1.5 m. A gross estimate of the overall window and door area is about 20% of the exterior wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No

<p>
<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Due to the eccentric position of the elevator shaft (an “U”- shape open core) in the 1980s portion, the dynamic response of this building showed intensive torsional vibrations in the 1980 structure causing excessive displacements to the old (1960) structure. The torsional eccentricity (distance between the centers of mass and stiffness) was equal to 7m in a building of 20 m maximum plan dimension. In the 1999 Athens earthquake, the building described in this contribution experienced severe damage caused by the tight connection of two structures with rather different dynamic properties. The damages included the extensive cracking in the exterior limestone masonry infill walls and the interior brick masonry infill walls, and the minor cracks in the flexible 1960s frame structure.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> The problems associated with the seismic performance of this building type are due to the tight connection of two structures with quite different dynamic properties. Since it is not possible to separate these two structures (i.e. the 1960 and 1980 portion of the building), the strengthening is required. The following options have been considered: a) strengthening of the 1960 frame, b)strengthening of the 1980 frame, or c) strengthening of both structures. The purpose of strengthening is to achieve an acceptable performance for the entire structure, to control the lateral displacements (drifts), and also to avoid excessive damage of the exterior and interior infill walls in future earthquakes. Strengthening of the old 1960 RC frame has appeared to be impractical and unreliable due to the poor quality of concrete and the lack of seismic detailing (inadequate amount of reinforcement, lack of stirrups, etc). Strengthening of the newer, 1980 frame, with the objective to reduce the excessive torsional effects in the structure and control the response of the old 1960 structure was considered. This option seemed to be very expensive, as it required strengthening of almost all columns and shear walls. Finally, it was decided to demolish all severely damaged infill walls and the frame at the first floor level (1960 structure), including the columns, beams and the floor slab, and to rebuild the brick infill walls at this floor level within the frames of the new structure. In addition, all cracks in the vertical elements were sealed with epoxy resins. Finally, three columns or shear walls in the new structure were strengthened to increase the torsional rigidity (locations STR 1-3 in Figures 2, 3 and 4). Beams at the first floor level had to be partially demolished and rebuilt with additional reinforcement (see Figures 2 and 12). These strengthening measures were effective in ensuring the overall seismic performance of the strengthened building (including the 1960 and 1980 portion) in accordance with the requirements of the current Greek design code.

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> Yes. Seismic strengthening is a common practice for this type of construction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> The work was done as a repair following damage due to the September 7, 1999 Athens earthquake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> The inspection on the retrofit of this construction was more thorough than it would be for a new construction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The construction was performed by a contractor, who was chosen by the owner, and the construction was supervised by the designer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> The performance was good in the aftershocks of Richter magnitude 4.5.
