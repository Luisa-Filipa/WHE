<strong>Building Type:</strong> Buildings with cast in-situ load-bearing reinforced concrete walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) and the other Republics of the former Soviet Union. Many buildings with cast in-situ load-bearing reinforced concrete walls can be found in Moldova. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Buildings with cast in-situ load-bearing reinforced concrete walls are widespread in many Republics of the former Soviet Union. There are many such buildings in Kyrgyzstan in areas with design seismicity of 8 and 9 on the MSK scale. The buildings with cast in-situ walls are typically medium- to high-rise buildings (4-18 stories high; often 12-stories high). High-rise buildings of this type (9-18 stories high) have basements. The load-bearing structure consists of cast in-situ reinforced concrete walls and precast reinforced floor slabs. Floor slabs are either flat slab structures, or, less often, hollow-core slabs. Buildings of this type do not have any frame elements (columns or beams). Facade walls are usually made of lightweight (ceramsite) concrete. Buildings of this type are supported by concrete strip or mat foundations. This building type is considered to be earthquake-resistant. Problems are mainly related to the quality of construction.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Square, solidRectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular or square; in some cases, the plan consists of two rectangles or squares.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 26-30
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 12-14
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Shear wall structure with walls cast in-situ
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system consists of reinforced concrete walls and reinforced concrete slabs. Walls and slabs are joined together in a rigid space (3-D) system. This system works as a uniform (box-type) construction. Floor slabs are either flat slab structures, or, less often, hollow-core slabs. Buildings of this type do not have any frame elements (columns or beams). Thickness of exterior (facade) walls is usually 300-400 mm, and the thickness of interior walls is 160-200 mm. Thickness of flat slabs and hollow-core slabs is 160 mm and 220 mm, respectively. Facade walls are usually made of lightweight (ceramsite) concrete; thickness is variable depending on the thermal insulation requirements. Buildings of this type are supported by concrete strip or mat foundations. Wall reinforcement is based on the Building Code requirements. Vertical reinforcement bars are located close to the door and window openings, as well as at the wall end zones and at the wall intersections. Distributed vertical reinforcement is typically installed throughout the wall length, typically in two layers. In addition, two layers of welded-wire mesh are typically installed close to the exterior wall surfaces. If the walls are perforated with openings, coupling beams (spandrel beams) are designed for bending and shear effects. The reinforcement bars are joined by welding or lap splices. Gravity load-bearing system: Gravity load-bearing structure consists of reinforced concrete walls and slabs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The total wall density in both directions is on the order of 15%. Wall density in one direction amounts to approx. 70-80% of the wall density in the other direction i.e. walls are rather uniformly distributed in the two principal directions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Typical window opening size is 1.3m (height)x1.8m (width), door openings: 2m (height)x1m (width). Overall window and door areas constitute up to 20% of the wall area. There are 20 to 25 windows in a building with plan dimensions of 28x26m.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Typical patterns of modification include the perforation of walls with door openings. This has been a very serious problem in Kyrgyzstan since 1992. There has been a trend of people purchasing apartments at a low cost and using them as shops. As a result of these modifications, the number of door openings on the exterior load-bearing walls has increased; fragments of the walls have been removed and apertures on the lower stories have been made. Modifications of this type have resulted in increased seismic vulnerability for buildings of this type. In an attempt to regulate this process in Kyrgyzstan, an annex to the Building Code has been developed, under the title #Change of the building function of some space of the existing apartment buildings# (SNiP 31-01-95). It is interesting to note that in Uzbekistan, modifications in the apartment buildings of this type are prohibited at the ground floor level.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Floor and roof slabs are of precast construction (either hollow core slabs or solid slabs).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Floor and roof slabs are of precast construction (either hollow core slabs or solid slabs).

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Buildings of this type have not been subjected to the effects of damaging earthquakes in Kyrgyzstan as of yet. However, many existing buildings of this type in Kichinev, Moldova, were exposed to an earthquake of intensity 8 on the MSK scale. Many of these 12-story buildings suffered damage in piers at the lower stories due to the poor quality of concrete construction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:</strong> The most common type of damage includes concrete crushing and spalling at the locations of construction joints, as well as the inclined diagonal cracks in the wall piers (due to the shear failure). Severe damage and collapse is not expected.
