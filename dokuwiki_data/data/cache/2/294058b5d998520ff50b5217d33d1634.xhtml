<strong>Report:</strong> 202

<p>
<strong>Building Type:</strong> PC Frame Buildings (Series 1-451)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Armenia
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong>

<p>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> This building typology can be found in all big cities in Armenia. Roughly estimated, around 15% of the multi-apartment building stock of the country consist of this typology.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Stone buildings, Mydis-type walls of cement mortar and crushed stones are standard with thicknesses of 50 cm. Stone masonry type with clear joints is rarely used where located at inner court that cannot be seen from the main roads. Pre-cast concrete void slabs. Seismic bands are provided around the floor slabs.Usually for 3 to 5-storey multi-apartment buildings, constructed between 1958 and 1970. Generally used for construction in seismic regions of intensity 7-8.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 25-60 years
</p>

<p>
<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> Yes

<p>
<strong>In practice as of:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Building Occupancy:</strong> Residential, 20-49 unitsResidential, 50+ units
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical number of stories:</strong> 3-5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Flat:</strong> Off
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Sloped:</strong> Off
</p>

<p>
<strong>Comments:</strong> Construction type typically on both flat and sloped (hilly) terrains.

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> The 1988 Earthquake with epicenter in Spitak, Armenia (Mw 6.9) affected buildings of this construction typology.The lack of unification between the seismic bands and the floor void slabs, as well as the floor void slabs supported by longitudinal walls, caused larger damages such as out-of-plane failures of stone-bearing walls located at the side of the buildings.
