<strong>Building Type:</strong> Rammed earth house with pitched roof (Nyumba yo dinda OR Nyumba ya mdindo)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Malawi
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Sassu, M., Ngoma,I
</p>

<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> The house type is found in all regions of Malawi and neighbouring countries which are Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania. This house type represents about 30% of total housing stock in the region.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This type of construction is used for residential purposes only. The building technique consists of in situ ramming of moist soil in a carefully aligned/placed mould. The mould is about (200mm-300mm) wide x (400mm-450 mm) long x 200 mm height. The plan of the house is rectangular. The roof is either grass thatch or iron sheets supported on timber poles. This type is found in all three regions of Malawi and bordering countries such as Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania. The strength of the wall is low and depends on the compacting effort applied. The expected seismic performance is poor. There are no vertical or horizontal reinforcements.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Round shapes have been attempted but presents challenges due to shape of moulds.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 4
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.1
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Rammed earth/pile construction
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system is earthen walls. The wall is made by use of a mould which is placed where the wall will be located. Moist soil is placed in it and rammed using a tamping wooden piece in at least three layers. The process is repeated until the proper height is reached. The wall height is about 2.5m with a thickness of between 0.20 m and 0.30.Gravity load-bearing system: The roof is directly supported by the rammed earth wall which in turn rests directly on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> About 30%. The densities depend on the compaction effort and moisture level. The soil characteristics has also significant contribution to wall densities. Higher densities would be achieved if the number of layers per mould flight was increased to say 4 or 5.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Generally three openings are provided, i.e. one door and two windows. The door is in front and so are the windows. The door is about 1.7m high x 0.6m wide. The windows are 0.3m wide x 0.6m high. The window and door areas are about 5% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Re-roofing and wall smearing i.e. smearing with specially prepared mud mortar. Re-roofing is done by removing the timber members and put new timber members i.e. rafters and purlins. The other re-roofing involves replacing the roof covering material be it grass or iron sheets.No structural modifications are made to the rammed earth walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: No foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Rammed earth walls start on leveled ground without digging into the ground. The reason is that the walls do not provide structural continuity against bending moments.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Earthen floor, unknown
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Earthen floor, unknown is actually Rammed earth floor with plaster/smear finishing. Sometimes the finish can be a cement screed of less than 15 mm.Floor is considered to be a flexible diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Bamboo, straw, or thatch roof
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Timber structural system (rafters and purlins): thatched roof supported on wood purlins which is in turn supported on rafters and rafters transfer the load to walls. Roof system is considered flexible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> Typical separation distance between buildings: 2-3 meters

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> The house is built by a special master builder who learns the job as an assistant. He learns the job as he helps with bringing the soil (as assistant). A pit is dug and water is poured in it overnight. The soil is only expected to be moist i.e. the soil must not retain the water. The tools used are a hoe, two buckets, a mould, a tamping wooden piece, and a scraper for removing soil from the mould.FOUNDATION: There is no foundation. The lines of the walls are marked on levelled ground, pegs are placed where necessary.WALL CONSTRUCTION: The wall is made of rammed earth. A site of the soil pit is identified with trials to make sure that the soil does not have a lot of clay content. Soil is dug and water poured in it to soak it over night. The moisture of the soil is critical so that remixing is done from time to time. The soil is then moved to the mould which is already placed in the proper place on the construction site. The soil is rammed in layers in the mould. It is nece
ssary to ensure that a proper compacting effort has been achieved before removing the mould.ROOFING: The roof is made up of grass thatch placed on timber poles made into a grid/mesh to retain the grass. The poles are supported on a timber pole beam which is itself supported on two king posts which are supported by timber pole beams spanning across the longitudinal walls. The two beams are placed at 1/4 points from the ends. Once the grass thatch has been placed, small sized timber poles are split and placed above grass and tied to poles below grass so that grass does not move out of place. This is done at 1/3 points all round.OPENINGS: The openings are few. Timber lintels are provided although not strong.This building is not typically constructed incrementally and is not genreally designed for its final constructed size.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction issues:</strong> The problems encountered during construction include supports at door and window openings. The other one is that there is no load sharing for wall support as there is no wall plate.

<p>
<strong>Labor requirements:</strong> The mason/builder, assistant, and others for drawing water from borehole, etc.The number of days required to complete the construction of walls is 2 weeks for walls. The roof takes 1 week.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 3:</strong> There are no standards for rammed earth buildings because it is seen as unconventional construction.Costing of rammed earth buildings is complicated due to involvement of relatives either to draw water and other tasks.

<strong>Additional comments on structural and architectural features for seismic resistance:</strong> The structural and architectural features are not made seismic resistance. The incorporation of seismic resistance would make the structure expensive for intend users.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Vertical irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Horizontal irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in walls:</strong> Very poor lateral resistance; lintels provided are very weak; soil structure is brittle and prone to crumbling.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Earthquake-resilient features in walls:</strong> Built in situ would have been a positive feature if the material was flexible.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in frames:</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Earthquake-resilient features in frame:</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in roof and floors:</strong> No ties between roof and wall; weak joining of roof members; and floor is made up of rammed earth which has no continuity.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Earthquake resilient features in roof and floors:</strong> Wide bearing area at roof support.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in foundation:</strong> The structure is built on ground level without embedding into the ground.The walls would not provide moment continuity.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> Repair following earthquake damage
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The owner - no architects or engineers are involved
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> Not very satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 6:</strong> Traditionally no retrofit is done because of the nature of the building material which poor joining properties once constructed.
