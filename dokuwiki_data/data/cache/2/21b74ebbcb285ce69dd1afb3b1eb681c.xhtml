<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of the Persian Empire, especially next to the desert(Kavir). This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and sub-urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> The &#039;Four arches&#039; or Char Taaqi (in Persian) derives its name from the four arches thatconnect the tops of four timber or masonry piers enclosing the space. It is an equilateralarchitectural unit consisting of four arches or short Barrel vaults between four corner piers,with a dome over the central square; this square and the lateral bays under the arches or barrelvaults together constitute a room of cruciform ground plan. This structural system developedabout 2500 years ago, after the earring system in the Old Persian Empire (Sasanian age). The maingoal of this building system was to create wide openings at four side of the structure. Thisbuilding system was used for special places that carry high population like fire temple (placewhere Persians worshiped the Fire God), mosque, bazaar and other public places. It is notthat difficult to built a dome over four arches. Further, dome structures are ideal for large spanstructures against gravity loads as it transforms them into horizontal and shear loads. Inaddition, for lateral loads, domes behave like a truss and distribute the load to other parts ofthe structure developing a perfect load path. This construction system has been considered the most prominent structural system in traditional Iranian architecture. These are basicallymonumental buildings developed close to the desert where there was not enough constructionmaterials that could take tensile stresses.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system is huge masonry piers connected by the arches at the topand the dome-roof system.Gravity load-bearing system: The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls: huge masonry piers connected by the arches at the top and the dome-roof system.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Plaster of paris was one of the materials that was used for the mortar.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typicalstructural wall density is more than 20 %. 15% to 30%.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Large openings are provided in all four sides in between huge pierslocated at the corners. Sometimes an opening is also provided in the roof for natural light. These are usually around 50cm in diameter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Some modifications could have been made in the roof opening and the shapes of the arches over time. The roofopenings could have been made smaller or larger, and the arches modified as shown in figures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone isolated footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Wooden beams or trusses and joists supporting heavy flooring
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Vaulted Masonry; The construction materials have no ductility. With building it in vault form, the forces distribute on surface.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Masonry roof, unknownVaulted masonry roofShallow-arched masonry roofEarthen roof, unknownVaulted earthen roofRoof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Vaulted Masonry; The construction materials have no ductility. With building it in vault form, the forces distribute on surface.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> These buildings do not share common walls with adjacent buildings; theyare mostly free standing buildings. However, sometimes when these are built in the middle of other buildings (as intersection), there is no gap between adjacent buildings. This building type was used as public places like temples, mosques, street or bazaar, intersections, public baths, ormaybe sometimes as house of an important person because with this technique the house could be constructedbigger and higher. In a typical building of this type, there are no elevators and no fire-protected exitstaircases. Depending on the building function, there could be up to four exits on all four sides.
