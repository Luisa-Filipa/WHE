<p>
<strong>Building Type:</strong> Rubble-stone masonry house
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Slovenia
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Marjana Lutman, Miha Toma#evic
</p>

<p>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in the area of Upper Posocje. The residential housing stock built before the World War II in that area is generally of this type. It represents 24 % of dwelling stock in that area. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Rubble-stone masonry houses are still found throughout Slovenia. This housing type is special because of its history. It represents a typical, older residential building in the northwestern part of Slovenia. After their destruction during World War I, these houses were rebuilt, mostly with the recycled stone material (from the buildings that were demolished). Many houses of this type were subsequently damaged during the last two earthquakes in Slovenia (1976 Friuli and 1998 Bovec). In order to preserve the country&#039;s architectural heritage, about 66% of these houses were strengthened after the earthquakes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 51-75 years

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typical shape of building plan is usually rectangular.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 13
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.7
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system consists of exterior and interior stone walls. The walls are generally uniformly distributed in both orthogonal directions, and the building plan is generally regular. With a few exceptions, the walls are not connected by means of wooden or iron ties. The thickness of walls varies from 40 to 70 cm, with spacing ranging from 3.0 m to 6.0 m. The walls are supported by foundation walls (strip foundations) made out of rubble masonry or there are no footings at all. Lateral load transfer to bearing walls is accomplished through roof and floor structures. The weakest links in this structural type are usually weak inner infill between exterior wythes of masonry, vertical joints between walls, and connections between roof /floors and walls. Gravity load-bearing system: The gravity-load bearing system consists of roof, floor structures and structural walls. Original or new roof structures are made out of timber and roofs are covered with ceramic tiles. In many cases original wooden floor structures have been replaced with reinforced concrete slabs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is up to 10 %. 9% to 12 %.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Average area of a window opening in front exterior wall is 1.2 m.sq. in the rural area and 1.7 m.sq. in the urban area. The door opening area in exterior and interior bearing walls is approximately 2.0 m.sq.. Maximum opening area is approximately equal to 16% of the front exterior wall area. The back exterior walls are usually not perforated with openings at all or in some cases there are smaller window openings (approx. area = 0.5 m.sq.).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> After the 1976 Friuli earthquake certain modifications on the buildings of this type were carried out, mainly combined with the repair and strengthening. Some examples are: construction of new r.c. slabs above the basement and ground floor, addition of balconies and exterior staircases, and new bathrooms. The replacement of existing interior stone masonry walls with brick masonry walls or reinforced concrete columns are rare. The extensions are usually built close to original buildings, however the old and the new parts have not been adequately connected together in the structural sense.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Wood beams with ballast and wood planks. The existing wooden floor/roof structures are not considered to be a rigid diaphragm unless they are tied with diagonal ties and connected to the walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Timber: wood planks or beams that support clay tiles. The existing wooden floor/roof structures are not considered to be a rigid diaphragm unless they are tied with diagonal ties and connected to the walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 10 meters. Typical Plan Dimensions: Length ranges from 9 m to 13 m, width ranges from 6 m to 10 m. Typical Story Height: Story height varies from 2.5 to 2.7 meters. Typical Span: Typical span is 3 - 6 meters.

<strong>Who typically builds this construction type?</strong> OwnerBuilder
</p>

<p>
<strong>Roles of those involved in the building process:</strong> The houses of the presented type were mainly built by local builder or by owners themselves, with the assistance provided by neighbours. The houses were built to be used by the owners; in some cases the builders live in the houses as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong> Construction of this type of houses is nonengineered and it is based exclusively on the builder&#039;s experience.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> The houses were built traditionally with the local construction materials: local lime-stone, sand and timber from local forests. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction issues:</strong> Poor quality of masonry, Lack of structural integrity, Poor wall-to-floor connections, Weak supports of new reinforced concrete floor structures which replaced old timber ones. The new reinforced concrete slabs are supported only with the interior wythe of the wall and is not attached to the exterior wythe.

<p>
<strong>Is earthquake insurance for this construction type typically available?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>What does earthquake insurance typically cover/cost:</strong> The whole area of Slovenia has been divided into the two “seismic insurance zones”. The residential buildings are divided into two categories depending on the age of construction: older buildings, built before or in 1965, and the newer buildings, built in 1966 or later. For the higher seismic zone, the annual insurance rate is 0.105 % of the building value for older buildings and 0.07 % for the newer buildings. For the lower seismic zone, the annual insurance rate is 0.07 % and 0.045 % of the building value for older and newer buildings respectively. The area of Upper Poso#je is situated in the higher seismic zone and this type of houses have been built before 1965. The usual insurance rate is therefore 0.105% of the building value. Houses with large cracks are sometimes refused for earthquake insurance. In the case of fine cracks the insurance company previously makes a copy of the cracks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Are premium discounts or higher coverages available for seismically strengthened buildings or new buildings built to incorporate seismically resistant features?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on premium discounts:</strong> In the case of complete seismic strengthening with all permits, these houses may be insured with discount: the annual insurance rate is 0.07% instead of 0.105% of the building value.
