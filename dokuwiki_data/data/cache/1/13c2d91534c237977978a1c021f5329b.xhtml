<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in northeastern parts of India covering the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura. The different tribes of these states have unique life-styles and habitats. However, their housing type falls within this category with slight changes in their appearance attributed to individual tribal identities. At national level about 11.4% of hosing stock consists of this type of houses (Vulnerability Atlas of India, 2006). In this category of houses the wall material comprises bamboo, thatch and grass etc. with a light weight roof of similar material but also mud, plastic, polythene, GI metal, and asbestos sheet. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas. Although more confined to rural areas a significant percentage of this type of housing is also found in towns of the region. However, in the last two decades a decrease of these traditional houses in urban areas of the region has occurred. Very limited numbers of houses are in urban areas (towns).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> The housing type is most common throughout the Northeast India which lies in the most severe seismic zone of the country (Zone V - corresponding to MSK IX). Majority of this type of houses are used for residential purposes. Typically these houses are built with light weight locally available material like bamboo, wooden planks, thatch etc. These housing types have traditional system of bamboo/wooden posts. Bamboo posts are inserted into the ground to actas compression members and are tied with horizontal bamboo/wooden girders with the help of bamboo ropes (cane) to give a proper shape and framing action. However, there is no protection of bamboo/wooden posts against decaying/termites or any other natural cause. The performance of these houses during the past earthquakes is unknown. However, during the discussions with local people about the performance of these houses in the past major earthquakes, it was noted that the majority of houses survived.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solidCurved, solid (e.g. circular, elliptical, ovoid)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Most of these buildings are rectangular in shape. A few tribes build in circular shapes as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 10-15
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 4-5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 41702
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Wooden structure: Load-bearing Timber Frame: Walls with bamboo/reed mesh and post (Wattle and Daub)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The vertical load-resisting system is timber frame. Structure provides a continuous load path. Load is transferred through wooden/bamboo beams and columns/ posts embedded into the ground. The lateral load-resisting system is timber frame. Roof truss/bracing; long wooden pieces / bamboo are used as beams and compression members. They are tied well with the help of bamboo rope/cane. Lateral forces are resisted by cantilever action of the embedded posts and the bracing effect of diagonal bracing members where they are provided.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Generally these are very light weight structures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 0-1%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 0-1%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is none. Bracing is not achieved by walls but by the timber posts and diagonal timber bracing where provided.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> This housing type has very limited openings. There is only one entrance. Some of the tribes have a rear or side exit as well in their houses. Generally, there is no window and there is no provision for ventilation, making the house very dark inside. A typical house has about 2-5% openings in the surface area of its walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> In recent times some changes are taking place in term of 1. Provision of back courtyards 2. Roofing material changing from thatch to corrugated galvanized Iron (CGI) sheets.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: No foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Bamboo posts are inserted into the ground. Generally, the depth is 1 meter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> There is no suspended flooring. Ground floor is simple earthen floor with mud plaster in some cases. At times the floor of the house is raised slightly. This safeguards against flooding and dampness during the rainy season. Bamboo matting is used to cover the mud floors.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Thatched roof supported on wood purlins; Wood planks or beams supporting natural stones slates; Wood planks or beams that support slate, metal, asbestos-cement or plastic corrugated sheets or tiles
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 3-4 (minimum) meters.

<strong>Roles of those involved in the building process:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong> The entire construction takes place under the master builder who has slightly more expertise in comparison to others in the village. This man has expertise in erecting wooden frames/trusses. He develops his expertise by assisting in the construction of a large number of houses. Over a period of time, due to his experience, he starts working as a master builder. No role is played by professionals such as architects/engineers.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Construction of this type of house generally takes place in the dry season / winters. Sourcing of construction materials like thatch/timber/bamboo are collected during winters only. Bamboo/wooden posts are erected and then beams/logs are connected and rafters placed and tied up. The wider community participates in the construction of this type of house. Indigenous/traditional tools are used in the construction. Generally nails or other steel materials are not used for making connections between various members. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size.

<strong>Additional comments on structural and architectural features for seismic resistance:</strong> ?Roofing framing is tied together w ith bamboo ropes (cane). ?There is not much maintenance done to these houses. Average life of a house is 10-15 years, after w hich the old house is abandoned due to deterioration of the material used. How ever, during the life span of houses, w alling and roofing material (thatch) is replaced 3-4 times.
