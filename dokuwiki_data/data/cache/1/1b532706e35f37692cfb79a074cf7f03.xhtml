<strong>Building Type:</strong> Rubble stone masonry walls with timber frame and timber roof
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> India

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Maharashtra state (around 15% of the total housing stock of approx. 3 million houses). Particularly common for the Marathwada region (formerly a part of the kingdom ruled by Nizam of Hyderabad); typically found in villages. A very similar type of construction is found in the state of Jammu and Kashmir (according to INTERTECT, 1984); for other states in India, refer to Vulnerability Atlas of India (BMPTC, 1996). This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This typical rural construction in central, southern, and northern India houses millions of people. It is cheap to construct using field stones and boulders, but extremely vulnerable in earthquakes because of its heavy roofs and poorly constructed walls. The load-bearing structure is a traditional timber frame system, known as &#039;khan&#039;. It is a complete frame with timber posts spanned at about 2.6 m. Thick stone walls (typical thickness 600 mm - 1.2 m) provide enclosure and partial support to the roof. Walls are either supported by strip footings of uncoursed rubble masonry or are without any footings at all. The roof structure consists of timber planks and joists. To help keep the interiors cooler during hot summer months (peak temperatures exceeding 40#C.), a 500-800 mm thick mud overlay covers the top the roof. This construction type is considered to be very vulnerable to earthquake effects. Many buildings of this type were damaged or collapsed in the 1993 Killari (Maharashtra) earthquake (M 6.4) with over 8,000 deaths.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Square, solidRectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Building plan is typically of a very regular shape, usually rectangular or square.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 14
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The vertical load-resisting system is timber frame load-bearing wall system. Gravity load-bearing system consists of timber frames-khands, which carry the weight of the roof and frame self-weight down to the stone pedestals. Stonewalls act as enclosure and carry mainly the self-weight down to the foundations (if provided). An exception is the case when there are no timber posts provided; in such a case the entire roof weight is carried by the walls. The lateral load-resisting system is timber frame load-bearing wall system. The load-bearing structure for this housing type is a traditional timber frame system, known as “khan”. It is a complete frame with timber posts spanned at about 2.6 m, with an average height of approximately 2 meters; spacing between the successive frames is 1.2 to 1.5 m. The posts are supported by above ground stone pedestals (there is no anchorage between the pedestals and the ground). Thick stone walls (typical thickness 600 mm - 1.2 m) provide enclosure and partial support to the roof. Walls are supported either by strip footings of uncoursed rubble masonry or there are no footings at all. Roof structure consists of timber planks and joists. For the sake of thermal comfort during hot summer months (peak temperatures exceeding 40#C.), a 500-800 mm thick mud overlay is provided atop the roof. Lateral seismic forces are transferred from the roof to the timber posts, which tend to sway laterally. As the posts are typically constructed adjacent to the stone walls (with a very small gap or no gap at all), the swaying timber frames induce out-of-plane seismic forces in the stone walls. In some cases, there are no timber posts in portions of a house, and entire lateral load from the roof is transferred to the walls.

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Wall density (area of walls in one direction/total plan area) ranges from 0.12 (larger houses) to 0.25 (houses with smaller plan dimensions and thick walls).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Typically one or two small door openings per wall; doors are generally smaller in size as compared to standard doors used in new houses; typically, there are no window openings, except for a small ventilator in a wall (typically 500 mm#) just below the eaves level. It is estimated that the total window and door widths constitute approximately on the order of 15-25% of the total wall length.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> In general, the buildings of this type have been modified over time. They are mainly built around the central courtyard and can be expanded horizontally by building additional rooms. In some cases, there is a vertical extension however it is not very common. Also, after the 1993 earthquake in Maharashtra, there was a general trend of removing heavy roofs in the buildings of this type.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingShallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Wood planks and joists covered with thick mud overlay. The buildings of this type are typically of a single-storey construction; therefore no floors have been provided.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> The roof structure per se is a flexible diaphragm, however due to a heavy mud overlay (a rigid block) the whole system behaves as a rigid diaphragm (this is an estimate).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 2 meters.

<strong>Roles of those involved in the building process:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong> Skilled artisans-wadars cut stones; masons (with a very basic training) construct walls and foundations; skilled carpenters-sutars construct timber frames.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Typically constructed by village artisans. Walls are constructed in a random uncoursed manner by using simply piled stones bound with mud mortar. Round stone boulders are usually picked up in the field and then used without any additional shaping. In some cases stones are cut with chisels and hammers in wedge-shaped blocks. Space between the interior and exterior wall wythes is filled with loose stone rubble and mud mortar. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size.

<strong>Unit construction cost:</strong> Unit construction cost: approximately US$50 (Rs.2,100) per sq. m. Note that the unit cost can be lower than the stated value, provided that the owners contribute own labour. The cost also depends on the type of mortar used in the construction; the stated value applies if cement mortar is used; if mud mortar is used instead of cement mortar, then the cost would be substantially lower. The cost would also be lower if recycled materials (stone boulders and headers from old house) are used.

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Buildings of this construction type suffered substantial damage in the 1993 Maharashtra earthquake. Close to 30,000 houses of this type collapsed, and other 200,000 houses were damaged. Typical patterns of earthquake damage and failures reported in the 1993 earthquake were: delamination and failure of stone masonry walls (out-of-plane) separation of the walls at corners and junctions lateral swaying of timber frames due to heavy roof weight and inadequate post-to-beam connections.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> Structural Deficiency: Delamination of exterior wall wythe - Description of a typical seismic strengthening provision used: Pointing of exterior walls in cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> Several thousand buildings of this type have been retrofitted using the above methodology after the 1993 Maharashtra earthquake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?:</strong> The work was done as a post-earthquake rehabilitation effort following the 1993 Maharashtra earthquake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> In this case, the same extent of inspection was made for the new construction and for the retrofitted buildings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The work was performed by the contractors (masons) contracted by the owners. Financial and technical resources were provided by the Government of Maharashtra. In some cases, owners subsidized the construction. In other cases, construction was sponsored by NGOs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> The buildings of this type were not subjected to a damaging earthquake as yet.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 6:</strong> Strengthening of New Construction : Wall: Use shaped stones in construction; Use cement/sand mortar; Construct concrete ring beam at the roof level; Use throughstones (header stones). Roof: Liimit the thickness of mud overlay to 200 mm. Timber frame: Install knee-braces to reinforce post-to-beam connections.
