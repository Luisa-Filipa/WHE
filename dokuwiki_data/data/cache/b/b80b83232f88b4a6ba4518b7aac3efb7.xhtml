<strong>Building Type:</strong> Single-family stone masonry house
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Italy
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Centro Italia, Umbria, Toscana, Alto Lazio, Marche, but also with some changes in other parts of Italy.The seismic performance is highly correlated to the masonry fabric and quality of bonding agents. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas. Most frequently found in medieval hilltop small and medium size town centers. The quality of the stonework in the towns tends to be better than in the rural examples.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> These buildings form the historic centres of most hilltop villages and towns in central Italy. They are arranged in long terraced arrays, with common party walls and variable number of stories on the hillside (up to 2 or 3) and valley side (usually 4 or 5, with a maximum of 6). The typical house is usually formed by one or two masonry cells, depending on the depth of the block, with a staircase running, usually but not necessarily, along the party walls. The masonry is made of roughly squared stone blocks set in lime mortar, and the walls are made of two leaves with a rubble core at the base, tapering at the upper floors. Limestone is used for the blocks, while a particular type of tuffa stone is used for the lintels above openings. At ground level there are sometimes vaulted structures, while the upper stories were originally spanned by timber beams, with joist and timber boards covered by tiles. The roof structure is usually original and made of timber trusses. In recent past, many of the original floors have been replaced either with iron “I” beams and jack arches (refurbishments occurred before the World War II) or more recently with weakly reinforced concrete slabs (last fifty years). Other alterations include vertical extensions, closing and opening of windows, introduction of hygienic services. A high proportion of these houses show traditional iron ties introduced in the 18th Century to tie together orthogonal walls and floors, to ensure better seismic performance. After the introduction of modern seismic codes in 1980s many buildings have undergone further strengthening, represented by RC ring beams and concrete jacketing of walls.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Roughly rectangular as usually part of arrays or terraces, but alterations and joining of cadastral units may result in different shapes. Also front and back walls are not necessarily parallel as are not the party walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 4 meters
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 6 meters
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3 meters
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system consists of masonry walls with or without metal ties. Gravity load-bearing system consists of single or double leaf masonry walls with rubble infill.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Although stone walls are commonly used, insertion of brickwork is not uncommon. The quality of the masonry can be very variable. Mortar is usually lime based.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Total wall area/plan area (for each floor) is from 0.17 to 0.25.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Opening layout is frequently altered over time, so that it is very often irregular from one floor to the next one. Typical percentage are 30% to 50% of wall surface on facade, much less on side walls, but with exceptions. In regular cases for each floor of each cell , there are two windows laid out in vertical arrays.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Addition of storeys, insertion of balconies and some rearrangement of interior walls. Also as buildings have existed for a long time, some modernization and modifications have been introduced, such as bathrooms and kitchens with running water.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> In some cases, following problems with uneven settlements, in recent years some of these houses might have been underpinned using micro-piles
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Vaulted masonry floorOther floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Other: wood planks or beams with ballast and concrete or plaster finishing As mentioned in the general description, originally vaulted system at ground floor and timber beams at the upper floors would be the typical arrangement, but in the last 50 years these have been replaced by precast joist system. In most cases the floor structure cannot be considered as a rigid diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Wooden beams or trusses with heavy roof covering
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> The main function of this building typology is single-family house. In a typical building of this type, there are no elevators and 1-2 fire-protected exit staircases. Building of this type can have as the one main entry so the two doors. These buildings are typically found in flat, sloped and hilly terrain. They do not share common walls with adjacent buildings. This value of 5 meters is average distance. Buildings of this type in some places are located close together and in other places are scattered When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 5 meters.

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> See above. However modern tools tend to be used for repairs, strengthening or upgrading interventions. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size. Buildings would have typically undergone several alteration and refurbishments during their life, including addition of stories, replacement of staircases and demolition /erection of bearing walls.

<p>
<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> A small proportion of these buildings collapsed in the town centres and usually these had very poor maintenance record, i.e. the buildings had not been occupied for a number of years. A greater proportion of similar buildings (still within 25% of the total number) collapsed in the smaller mountain villages closer to the epicentre. Two main factors can be considered as possible causes of this disparity, assuming a similar level of seismic excitation: worse construction quality, and the fact that the houses in the villages are isolated, whereas in the towns they are built in the rows. Figure 9 shows a house in the historic centre of Nocera Umbra, subjected to the 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake. Typical “X” cracks developed in masonry walls, in this case caused by the increased stiffness of roof structure that had been replaced by reinforced concrete slab with ring-beam. Figure 10 illustrates the earthquake damage associated with the inadequate ring beam-wall connection. The roof had slipped on the masonry and caused the wall damage.

<strong>Additional comments section 5:</strong> Seismic features for a typical building of this type are illustrated in Figure 7. Note the regular arrays of floor ties in one of the units, irregular distribution of wall ties in the next one, and corner return stones in the third unit. Due to the absence of adequate connections between internal and external leaves of masonry, a partial collapse of the area above the window opening took place.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> Figure 11 illustrates the following seismic strengthening provisions: RC ring beams and anchorage of floor beams to the wall, repointing and grouting using cement-based grout, corner return in brickwork, and the installation of concrete window frame. Figure 12 illustrates modern anchors with anchorage plates and concrete lintels over openings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> Seismic strengthening is recommended by a local authority and required when other forms of alteration or improvement are performed. It is quite common in design practice.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> The work could be performed in both cases.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> An architect or engineer is required to sign the strengthening design submitted to the local building authority.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> Generally good, but highly dependent on the quality of implementation of the strengthening.
