<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in most large cities of Kyrgyzstan and other republics of the former Soviet Union. In Kyrgyzstan, buildings of this construction type can be found in the following cities: Bishkek, Tokmok, Och, Karakol (Kyrgyzstan). Large panel buildings account for up to 35 - 40% of the multi-story residential building stock in the capitol, Bishkek. Buildings of this type are less common in other cities mentioned above. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas. There are large panel buildings in suburban areas too.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Prefabricated concrete panel buildings with monolithic panel joints have been constructed since 1965 in various republics of the former Soviet Union, including Kyrgyzstan. This type of prefabricated construction is known as seria 105. Apartment buildings of this type are usually 5-9 stories high. The foundations are made of cast in situ reinforced concrete. Steel dowels are provided in the foundations to ensure anchorage of steel rebars located in the panels and in the panel joints. The load-bearing structure in large panel buildings consists of reinforced concrete panels combined to form a box-type rigid system by means of special joints. This building type is considered to be one of the most earthquake-resistant construction types in the former Soviet Union.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> A typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 39.6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 10.8
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Large panel precast walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Gravity load-bearing structure consists of large reinforced concrete wall panels and concrete floor slabs. The lateral load-resisting system consists of large reinforced concrete panels acting as shear walls. All wall and floor panels are combined together, thus creating a rigid structure by means of special joint system. Horizontal and vertical steel dowels are provided in wall and floor panels. Once the panels are erected in their final position, the dowels are welded, and the gaps between the panels are filled with cast in situ concrete. Shear stress in the joints is resisted by means of shear keys. Vertical steel bars are placed close to the window and door openings in the panels. These bars are located in vertical joints. Figure 5 shows a typical precast floor panel with steel dowels and grooves (shear keys) for achieving monolithic concrete panel joints. Details of a typical wall panel without openings are shown on Figure 6, whereas a typical panel with a wall opening is shown on Figure 7. Horizontal and vertical sections of exterior wall panels are shown on Figures 8 and 9, respectively. Horizontal and vertical sections of an interior panel are shown on Figures 10 and 11, respectively. Wall and floor panels are of room size dimensions. Interior wall panels and floor panels are of normal-weight concrete (density 24 kN/m3), and the facade (exterior)-wall panels are of light-weight concrete. Thickness of the interior wall panels is typically 120mm or 160mm. Size of typical wall panel is 2.7 m (width) x 3 m (height) or 3.6 m (width)x3.0 m (height). Thickness of a floor panel is 160 mm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The ratio of total wall area/plan area is about 0.14. Wall density in the two principal directions is not equal; in one of the directions, wall density is less by 20 to 30% as compared to the other direction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Large panel prefabricated construction technology does not allow for a variation in the size of door and window openings. Usually, for a 3.6 m long panel, the window size is 1.82 m (width) X 1.53 m (height); for a 2.7 m long panel - the window size is 1.24 m (width) X 1.53 m (height). The size of a balcony door (together with window) is either 2.25 m or 1.66 m wide and 1.9 m in height. The overall window and door area account for 17% of the overall wall area. There are 16 windows for a building with plan dimensions of 10.8 m X 25.2 m
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Buildings of this type are generally standardized and therefore modifications are not very common. Typical modifications include perforation of new door openings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Structural concrete: Precast solid slab panels Floor/roof considered to be a rigid diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Structural concrete: Precast solid slab panels Floor/roof considered to be a rigid diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 10 meters.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> Some recommended methods for seismic strengthening are: installation of reinforced concrete bushing keys, applying reinforced gunite on panel surface, injection of polymers in cracks. It is usually not required to strengthen buildings of this type. Poor quality of construction is sporadic and does not make significant influence on the reliability of buildings. In Kyrgyzstan, we have some experience with strengthening the existing load-bearing structures. In Uzbekistan, there is experience with strengthening the buildings damaged by the 1978 Gazly earthquake; damaged buildings were constructed without earthquake-resistant features (as the area was thought to be of low seismic risk i.e. seismicity 6 on 12 intensity scale).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> N/A
