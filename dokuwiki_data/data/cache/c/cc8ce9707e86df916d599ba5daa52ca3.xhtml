<strong>Building Type:</strong> Stone Masonry House : Rubble stone without/with mud/lime/cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Switzerland

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in urban residential areas Basel and other cities in Switzerland, but also in German cities. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas. Only around 1850 a new law came out in Basel that allowed the construction of houses outside the old town wall. In the second half of the 19th century the town spread very rapidly and soon covered the area it covers today.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This building type was mainly constructed as residential buildings in the second half of the 19th century until the beginning of the 20th century in the vastly expanding city of Basel, but also in other Swiss cities. The buildings are made of unreinforced masonry with timber floors,are four to five stories high and are attached to each other. The unreinforced masonry walls are usually made of simple stone (more or less regularly cut) or brick masonry, the thickness of the stone masonry walls being larger. The mortar used is usually lime mortar. In some cases, a mixed masonry was used, especially at the ground floors, with larger, well cut stones for the outer layer of the facade walls and simple stones or bricks arranged behind. The buildings are rather regular in plan and elevation. However, the timber floors are often not anchored to the masonry walls and the front and back facades usually have rather large openings for the windows whereas the side walls are solid walls used as fire division wall. The seismic performance of these buildings is expected to be rather poor.

<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 10-20
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 8-9
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.8-3.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The unreinforced masonry walls also act as the gravity load-bearing structure to which the loads are transmitted by the timber floors. The lateral load-resisting system consists of unreinforced masonry walls. Various types of unreinforced masonry were used: Bricks, simple stone and rubble stone. Also a combination of different masonry was used. The type of masonry was used in specific buildings is generally not identifiable because of the plaster finish. Often for the outer layer of the facade walls, larger cut stones are used, especially at the lower floors, with simple stones (more or less regular) or bricks arranged behind. The mortar used is usually lime mortar.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Often a combination of different types of stones and brick was used. The mortar used is usually lime mortar.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Ratio of the wall area to the plan area: Ground floor: Walls parallel to the facade=0.064; Walls orthogonal to the facade walls=0.064; Total wall area (sum of both directions)/plan area=0.128; Upper floors: Walls parallel to the facade=0.05; Walls orthogonal to the facade=0.055; Total wall area (sum of both directions)/plan area=0.105.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> The openings for window and doors are positioned only at the front and back facades. At each floor there is typically a window every 2.5 to 2.8 meters. For typical building widths of 6 or 9 meters, there are two or three windows at the back and two or three windows at the front facade wall per story, with a total window area of about 20% of the facade walls (10% considering the overall wall surface area including the fire division walls between the buildings which have no openings).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Usually, modernizations of kitchens and bathrooms have been introduced. In the case where the ground floor is used for a commercial purpose, the ground floor windows are often enlarged and interior walls are replaced by columns of steel or reinforced concrete.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> The buildings usually have a basement. The walls from the upper floors rest on the basement walls which are made of brick or simple stone masonry with lime mortar; towards the end of the 19th century rammed concrete was also used. The basement walls rest on isolated or strip footings of masonry and later of rammed concrete. Rammed concrete started being used for foundation footings at the end of the 19th century. Instead of cement, often hydraulic limes were used as a matrix.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Vaulted masonry floor
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Timber: Wood planks or beams with ballast and concrete or plaster finishing, Wood plank, plywood or manufactured wood panels on joists supported by beams or walls The floor above the basement consists sometimes of a vaulted system whereas for the upper floors and the roof, timber beam construction is used. The timber floors do not act as rigid diaphragms. In addition the timber beams are often not anchored to the masonry walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> In most cases the buildings are pure residential buildings, and only in some cases the ground floor is used for a commercial purpose. In these cases the windows at the ground floor were often enhanced afterwards.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural and architectural features for seismic resistance:</strong> Lateral load path: The load path from the walls to the ground is guaranteed. However, since the timber floors are generally not anchored to the walls, the load path from the floors to the walls may not be given. Building configuration: In the original configuration (as built) the buildings are regular with regards to both the plan and the elevation. However, in the cases where alterations were made at the ground floor in order to accommodate shops, the resulting ground floor is often less stiff then the upper stories. Wall proportions: the height to thickness ratio of the facade walls is always less than 13. However, for inner walls the ratio can be up to 26. Quality of building material: The use of lime mortar is no longer allowed by the codes in Switzerland.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> So far, in Switzerland only the seismic strengthening using CFK lamellae (in some cases prestressed) has been used to increase the shear resistance of unreinforced masonry buildings (not necessarily the building type described).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?:</strong> The seismic strengthening was only applied on undamaged buildings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The strengthening design is performed by an engineer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> There is no experience, since no earthquake has occurred in Switzerland in recent times which has damaged the specific building type. Tests on masonry walls strengthened with CFK lamellae showed an improvement of the shear resistance of the walls. An important issue concerning this type of strengthening is the anchorage of the lamellae.
