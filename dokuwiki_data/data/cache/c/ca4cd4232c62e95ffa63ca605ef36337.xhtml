<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> The typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular shape.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 20
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 4-Mar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Moment Resisting Frame: Designed for gravity loads only, with URM infill walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete moment resisting frame. Columns and walls give stiffness tothe structure, which controls the lateral drift. The common size of columns is 600 mm X 600 mm and for walls are150 mm thickness.The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). The roofs are designed totransmit gravity loads to the slabs, beams, and columns. The walls are from the non-load bearing wall system. Allexternal walls and partition walls are 9-inch brick walls. Internal partitions are timber framing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Structural Concrete: Moment resisting frame, designed for gravity loads only (predating seismic codes i.e. no seismic features)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 1-2%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 1-2%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural walldensity is up to 5 %. 2% (1% -5%).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> A typical house has approximately several windows, with average size of 2.4 sq. m.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footingShallow Foundation: Mat foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> The typical separation distance between buildings is 10 meters or more.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Structural concrete: cast in place and precast solid slabs. Floor/roof are considered to behave as rigid diaphragms.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Timber: thatched roof supported on wood purlins. Floor/roof are considered to behave as rigid diaphragms.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> When separated from adjacentbuildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 10 meters.

<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Developers normally build structures of this type. Process start with the foundation of the building, then columns and brick walls are built, finally beams and roofs are made at the time to get a monolithic structure. The tools typically used in this type of construction, are hammers,nails, construction wire, etc. and the equipment used include concrete vibrator, concrete mixer and others. To start the construction of the building one needs to get a construction license. Municipal authorities are in charge of giving this license to the builder companies.Each housing project must have four kinds of technical drawings: structural drawings, architectural drawings, water installation drawings and electric installation drawings. Municipal authorities need to approve this technical information in order to get construction license.Construction typically takes place over time, buildings are originally designed for a specific number of stories. However, it is commonly found that o
wners decide to build additional stories some years later of the end of the original construction.
