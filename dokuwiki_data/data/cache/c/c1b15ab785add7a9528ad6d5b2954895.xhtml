<strong>Building Type:</strong> Reinforced Masonry Building: Clay brick masonry in cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Colombia

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> This type of single-story buildings can be found easily in urban areas throughout the country (see Figure 1). The construction of small houses using this structural system is increasing in the last years because of its use as affordable housing (economically supported by the government for low income level families). In big cities like Bogot# and Medell#n, these types of buildings can be found as multistory buildings up to 10 stories (see Figure 2). The relevant type in this report will be single-story buildings. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and sub-urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This type of single-story housing is typically built in urban areas around the country. Nowadays, multistory buildings up to 10 stories can also be found with the same structural system and is generally used for residential purposes; however, this report focuses on single-story buildings. This type of structure is, in general, earthquake resistant but the construction process should be somehow improved in terms of controls and checks. The vertical and horizontal loads are supported by the reinforced masonry walls. The vertical reinforcement bars are placed in the hollow cores of the clay masonry units and the horizontal reinforcement bars in between the horizontal bed joints of the units (the separation depends on the selected energy dissipation capacity).

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 10-15
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 6-9

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Reinforced Masonry: Clay brick masonry in cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced masonry walls. The horizontal actions are supported by masonry walls reinforced with vertical and horizontal steel rebar. The amount of vertical and horizontal reinforcement and the quantity of mortar-filled cores of the masonry walls depend on the selected energy dissipation capacity (R-factor). The criteria to select the energy dissipation capacity of the building is the responsibility of the structural engineer and should be based on experience, available materials at the construction site, location of the structure (closely related to the earthquake prone areas) since low energy dissipation structures are not allowed on high seismic areas, etc. The R-factor represents the structural response modification factor (behavior factor in the Eurocodes) and the basic values are tabulated in the Colombian seismic code for different structure types and energy dissipation capacities [3]. The building type under study corresponds to masonry walls with intermediate energy dissipation capacity (Ro=2.5 acc. to [3]). For this type of building, only the cores that contain vertical reinforcement are filled with mortar. The maximum distance between vertical reinforcement is 1.20 meters and there should be at least one bar of 12mm diameter located at the end of the walls and next to the openings. The horizontal reinforcement is placed each 0.6 meters in between the horizontal bed joints and is a bar of 4 mm diameter, in the openings two bars of 10 mm diameter are placed at the top and bottom with an extension of 0.6 meters into the wall (see Figure 5). At wall ends, where the horizontal and vertical reinforcement meet each other, the horizontal reinforcement is connected to the vertical through a standard loop with a length depending on the steel type and rebar diameter. Splices in the horizontal reinforcement should be generally avoided. In order to fulfill this requirement, in places where it is not possible to use a continuous rebar (i.e. walls longer than the maximum length of the rebar) a hook will be inserted in the filled cores (where a vertical reinforcement is placed). Gravity load-bearing system: The vertical load-resisting system is reinforced-masonry walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> The walls are made of clay or concrete block masonry. Clay hollow units are most commonly used (cf. Figure 7, 8 and 9).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 3-4%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical total wall area/plan area is between 3.0 % and 5.5 % in each direction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> The openings are often located in the facade and there may be one or two openings of 1.2 to 1.5 meters width equally spaced (see Figure 3 and Figure 4).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Typical patterns of modifications observed are vertical expansions (adding new stories) and in some cases adding division walls for new rooms.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Mat foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> The foundation is often a concrete slab, with longitudinal reinforcement for bending. The vertical reinforcement for the walls is placed before casting the slab, so the correct location is important since this will define the final wall location.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Structural concrete: Solid slabs (cast-in-place), Waffle slabs (cast-in-place)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> The roof system consists of corrugate sheets supported on steel trusses (normally tube sections of 2#x1#x1/4# (Figure 6).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> These buildings do not share walls with adjacent buildings and are normally located conforming lines of housing (separated from each other) called #conjuntos#. They represent several buildings of the same type with small gardens inside and public areas for each #conjunto#. They are normally separated several meters from other structures.

<p>
<strong>Roles of those involved in the building process:</strong> Private contractors or construction companies, and in some cases they are contracted by the government.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong> The constructor has to be civil engineer or architect with more than 3 years of experience, and there is a compulsory inspection during the construction and has to be done by a civil engineer or architect with more than 5 years of experience.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Depending on the size of the project, many or few builders are involved in the construction process. The mat foundation is cast in situ and the vertical reinforcement is placed before the cast, then the masonry units are assembled and the horizontal reinforcement is placed in between the horizontal bed joints of the units. Normally at the top of the wall, a concrete beam is built and supports for the roof are placed in the casting process, then the truss system for the roof is installed and the corrugated sheets are placed. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.

<p>
<strong>Applicable codes or standards:</strong> The current code is from 2011 (NSR-10) [3] #Norma Sismoresistente Colombiana# and all of chapter #D# is about masonry structures. The first code (in 1984) established the first parameters and guided the design and construction, each chapter provides the minimum requirements of the materials and tests that have to be done during the construction. The earthquake requirements are defined in chapter #A# of the code, chapter #I# is about technical supervision and chapter #K# is about complementary requirements depending on the occupancy and importance of the buildings. Law 400 of 1997 [9], defines the minimum requirements of professionals for designing, constructing and supervising.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Process for building code enforcement:</strong> A specific governmental organization authorizes the construction after a complete set of architectural, structural and technical (i.e. hydraulic, electric) design memories and blueprints are submitted and signed by the each responsible professional.

<strong>Additional comments section 3:</strong> The first Colombian code was developed in 1984 defining the design and construction requirements for reinforced masonry buildings and other types of structural systems. The code was updated in 1998 and the last version was in 2011, being more strict and specific. For reinforced masonry buildings, the code defines the minimum requirements for design, construction and maintenance but although the code is considered as law, the controls during the construction are not enough and often the requirements are not completely followed.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural and architectural features for seismic resistance:</strong> 1) Due to the light roof system it can#t be considered as rigid, but it should maintain its integrity. 2) In general there are no floor construction in the relevant building type of this report.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Vertical irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Horizontal irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in walls:</strong> The openings on the walls are in general too big (bigger than # the distance between the adjacent cross walls). In these cases the walls cannot be considered part of the structural system and the remaining walls should be able to support the horizontal actions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Earthquake-resilient features in walls:</strong> The walls are reinforced and designed to support lateral loads and in general the mass of the structures is low (only one or two stories)

<strong>Additional comments section 5:</strong> The first Colombian code was developed in 1984 defining the design and construction requirements for reinforced masonry buildings and other types of structural systems. The code was updated in 1998 and the last version was in 2011, being more strict and specific. For reinforced masonry buildings, the code defines the minimum requirements for design, construction and maintenance but although the code is considered as law, the controls during the construction are not enough and often the requirements are not completely followed.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> If new constructions follow the design code, no strengthening scheme is needed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> The work should be done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The seismic retrofit is controlled by the contractor and the inspector, both have to be engineers or architects.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> There was no opportunity to observe the performance of retrofitted buildings.
