<strong>Building Type:</strong> Buildings with hollow clay tile load-bearing walls and precast concrete floor slabs
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Ulugbek T. Begaliev, Svetlana Uranova
</p>

<p>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in large parts of Kyrgyzstan: Most of them are located in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Buildings of this type are characterized with load-bearing masonry walls and precast concrete floors. Typical buildings of this type are 3 to 4 stories high and they are characterized with the two longitudinal walls and several cross walls. There are many existing buildings of this type in the Kyrgyzstan, and most of them were constructed in the 1960&#039;s. This construction practice was banned after 1966, in Code provisions which required restricted size of cores in hollow clay tiles (blocks). The exterior walls are made of hollow clay masonry tiles (blocks). In some cases there are two wall wythes: the exterior wythe made of hollow clay tiles and the interior wythe made of solid clay bricks. Floor system consists of precast reinforced concrete hollow core slabs. Buildings of this type were built in areas with high seismic design intensity (8, 9 and higher on the MSK scale). This building type is considered rather vulnerable to seismic effects.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 51-75 years
</p>

<p>
<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>In practice as of:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Building Occupancy:</strong> Residential, 50+ units
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical number of stories:</strong> 4
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Flat:</strong> Typically
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Sloped:</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Comments:</strong> Usually there are 32-64 units in each building.

<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 60
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 12
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.7
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: Lateral load-resisting system consists of exterior walls of small-size clay block masonry and interior brick masonry walls. The exterior walls are made of hollow clay masonry tiles (blocks). The block dimensions are: 138 mm (height)x120mmx250mm. The blocks have oval hollow cores (90mmx16mm). The area of the cores accounts for 25-33 % of the block area. Due to the large area of hollow cores, masonry is characterized with rather low tensile resistance. Usually mortar is of a poor quality. In some cases, exterior walls consist of two wythes; the exterior wythe is made of hollow clay tiles whereas the interior wythe is made of solid bricks (dimensions 250 mm thickness x 120mm x 70 mm). Floor system consists of precast reinforced concrete hollow core slabs. Dimensions of slab panels are 5.86m length x1.2m width. The panels are combined in a uniform diaphragm by means of reinforced concrete belt (cast in-situ reinforced concrete beam). Windows and door lintels are of precast concrete construction. Gravity load-bearing system: Gravity load-bearing structure consists of load-bearing masonry walls and concrete floor slabs.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Masonry: Clay brick/block masonry walls: Unreinforced brick masonry in cement mortar with reinforced concrete floor/roof slabs
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Typical window size is 1.2m x 1.2m. Typical door size is 0.9m(width) x 1.9m(height). The overall window and door area accounts for 10 to12% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> There are lot of modifications at the ground floor level in buildings of this type. Typical modifications include installation of new door and windows openings, complete/partial removal of existing walls, and horizontal extension (addition of rooms).

<p>
<strong>Process for building code enforcement:</strong> Building permit will be given if the design documents have been approved by State Experts. State Experts check the compliance of design documents with pertinent Building Codes. According to building bylaws, the building cannot be used without the formal approval of a special committee. The committee grants approval (permit) if design documents are complete and the construction has been carried out in compliance with Building Codes.
