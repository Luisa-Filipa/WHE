<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> There are about 30 base isolated buildings in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). In 1982, two 3-story brick masonry wall buildings were built in the area with high seismicity (9-10 per MSK scale). A residential block (microdistrict) of 9-story concrete large panel buildings protected with seismic isolation belt was built in the period 1983-1990. Several 9-story large panel concrete buildings were built in the center of Bishkek. One of the buildings is also equipped with a dynamic damper. Some buildings with seismic isolation belt were built in Kazahkstan and Russia (Kamchatka).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Sliding belt is a base isolation system developed for seismic protection of buildings by reducing and limiting the level of seismic forces. The sliding belt system is installed at the base of the building, between the foundation and the superstructure. The foundation is usually made of cast-in-situ concrete and the superstructure is typically a loadbearing wall structure, either 9-story large concrete panel system or 3-story brick masonry construction. Once the earthquake base shear force exceeds the level of friction force developed in the sliding belt, the building (superstructure)starts to slide relative to the foundation. It is expected that the lateral load transferred to the superstructure is approximately equal to the frictional force that triggers the sliding of the structure. The sliding belt consists of the following elements: a) sliding supports, including the 2 mm thick stainless steel plates attached to the foundation and 4 mm Teflon (PTFE) plates attached to the superstructure, b) reinforced rubber restraints for horizontal displacements (horizontal stop) and c) restraints for vertical displacements (uplift). A typical large panel building with plan dimensions 39.6m x10.8 m has 63 sliding supports and 70 horizontal and vertical restraints. The sliding belt scheme was developed in CNIISK Kucherenko (Moscow) around 1975. The first design application in Kyrgyzstan was made in 1982. To date the system has been applied on over 30 buildings in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. All these buildings are residential buildings and are presently occupied. Base isolated buildings of this type have not been exposed to the effects of damaging earthquakes as yet.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: Lateral load-resisting system includes the superstructure (e.g. large reinforced concrete panel construction or brick masonry construction) and the foundation. The sliding belt is installed at the base of the building, between the foundation and the superstructure. The sliding belt consists of the following elements: a) sliding supports, including the stainless steel plates attached to the foundation and the Teflon (PTFE) plates attached to the superstructure, b) reinforced rubber restraints for horizontal displacements (horizontal stop), and c) restraints for vertical displacements (uplift). The steel plates are 2 mm thick; the plate width is approximately equal to the foundation width, and the length depends on the size of the Teflon plate located at the center (usually projects by 150 mm on each side). The dimensions of Teflon plates are usually 400 mm x 400 mm for 9-story buildings and 200 mm x 200 mm for 5-story buildings; typical plate thickness is 4 to 6 mm. Horizontal stops consist of rigid reinforced structure with steel plates and a rubber damper. Vertical stops consist of steel anchor bolts. A typical large panel building (plan dimensions 39.6m x10.8 m) is equipped with 63 sliding supports and 70 horizontal and vertical restraints. A gap between rubber damper and sliding support for a 9-story building is usually 50 mm; this means that the horizontal stops will be activated once the building has moved by 50 mm in the horizontal direction. The recommended “seismic gap” ranges from 100 to 120 mm. In buildings constructed in Bishkek 300 mm gap was provided. No special provisions were made for flexible water supply and electrical facilities in the buildings protected with this system. Once the earthquake base shear force exceeds the level of frictional force developed in the sliding belt (approximately equal to 10% of the building weight), the building (superstructure) starts to slide relative to the foundation. The design recommendations state that the frictional coefficient value for Teflon-steel sliding is 0.1 (unless a different value is obtained by the tests). However, it should be noted that once the sliding is initiated, building continues to vibrate and restraints get activated as well. The analysis is based on rather complex formulas based of research studies that have been modified for the design practice. Simplified design calculations are not commonly used in the design of this construction type; comprehensive analysis is deemed required. Seismic design of the superstructure is performed based on the results of the dynamic analysis. The level of seismic forces (seismic demand) is reduced as compared to the conventional buildings by up to 50%. The sliding belt scheme was developed by CNIISK Kucherenko in Moscow around 1975; other institutes in the former Soviet Union also contributed to the development. Late L. S. Kilimnik was the leader in the development of the seismic belt system. The first design applications of seismic belt scheme were made in Bishkek in 1982. Two types of tests, static tests under horizontal loads and dynamic tests of full-scale buildings using the vibration equipment, were conducted in 1980. The design recommendations for base isolated buildings of this type were developed based on the results of these tests. Gravity load-bearing system: Gravity load-bearing structure is a conventional building construction, either large panel construction or brick masonry construction. Majority of base isolated buildings of this type are large panel concrete buildings with monolithic joints (seria 105). This construction type was described in detail in another contribution from Kyrgyzstan (by S. Uranova and U. Begaliev). Brick masonry buildings are 3-story high and are equipped with the reinforced concrete members and steel mesh, typical for brick masonry construction in the former Soviet Union. It should be noted, however, that the construction of conventional 3-story high brick masonry construction was otherwise not permitted in high seismic zones (intensity 9 to 10 on the MSK scale).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Total wall area/plan area is about 0.14. Wall density in two principal directions is not equal; in one of the directions wall density is less by 20 to 30% as compared to the other direction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Wall openings are same as in typical large panel buildings. Usually, for a 3.6m long panel, a window size is 1.82m(width)x1.53m(height); for 2.7m long panel - window size is 1.24m(width)x1.53m(height). The size of a door is 0.9m(width)x2m(height). The size of a balcony door (together with window) is either 2.25m or 1.66 m(width) or and 1.9m (height). Overall window and door areas make up to 20% of the overall wall area. There are 16 windows for a building with 10.8m x 25.2m plan dimensions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Typical patterns of modification include the perforation of walls with door openings and the creation of door opening instead of the window.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Foundation include seismo-isolation sliding belt
</p>

<strong>Unit construction cost:</strong> For load-bearing structure only (including the seismic belt) the cost is about 230$/m.sq. For a similar prefabricated concrete panel building (seria 105) without a seismic belt the construction cost would be US$ 150-200/m.sq. Therefore, the increase in unit cost due to the installation of seismic belt is in the range from 15 to 50 %.
