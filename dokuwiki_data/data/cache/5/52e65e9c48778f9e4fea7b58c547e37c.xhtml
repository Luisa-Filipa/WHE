<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> This type of construction is practiced in all three regions of Malawi and in neighbouring countries i.e. Zambia and Tanzania. The percentage of this type of housing is estimated at over 45 %.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This type of building is found both in urban and rural areas throughout Malawi. It is a construction type that is gaining popularity at the moment; it is estimated that it constitutes 45% of the country&#039;s housing stock. The thatched roof is supported by unburnt mud brick walls built in mud mortar. The walls are built on a stone platform raised above ground for the purpose of protection from floods. These buildings are built without any horizontal and vertical reinforcement. The strength of the building is very low. This type of construction is considered to be very vulnerable to earthquake effects. In the 1989 Salima earthquake (magnitude 6), 9 people died and over 50,000 people were left homeless. Many buildings of this type suffered extensive damage or collapsed.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Adobe block wallsOther
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The wall takes the load from the roof and wall elements. The walls are placed on a raised platform as a way of keeping above ground/surface water levels during the rainy season. This platform may be considered as a foundation because it projects outside the wall thickness and is generally constructed of stone. However, the connection between the wall and the raised platform is not structural, so there is no transfer of lateral forces at this point. The connection between the roof and the wall does not provide lateral transfer of forces.Gravity load-bearing system: The roof loads are supported on the timber members which are supported on walls. Generally gable walls are used both internally as room partitions and at the extreme ends of the building.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Other: unreinforced unburnt clay bricks (zidina) in mud mortar

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> The number of openings is more than one i.e. could be two doors and two to three windows depending on the size of the building. 8% estimated as overall window and door areas as a fraction of the overall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Some extensions have been made. In some cases the roofing material has been changed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Other Foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Other:Stone raised wall is built to support wall and for rainwater clearance i.e. to avoid water touching the walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> The floor is made up of rammed earth with mud smear finish or cement floor screed.

<p>
<strong>Roles of those involved in the building process:</strong> The mason/bricklayer lives in this type of construction. First the owner hires brick moulders to mould the bricks. The bricks are dried as a curing process. the mason then marks the ground to peg corners and openings. Mud mortar pit is selected and then building starts. The mason/bricklayer lays the bricks with others bring the mortar until roof level.The carpenter comes in at this stage to make the roof and fix doors and windows to complete the construction.No engineers or architects are involved in the design/construction of this housing type.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> The house is constructed by masons/bricklayers. General knowledge is used during construction.FOUNDATION: The ground is levelled. Stone wall 0.4m wide is built along the wall perimeter from ground level in mud mortar to a height of 0.4m. WALL CONSTRUCTION: The dry clay/mud blocks form the masonry units with mud mortar as the joining medium. The procedure is like any masonry wall construction. The mortar thickness is 10mm - 15 mm. At the roofing level of the wall, a wall plate is introduced which is generally of timber poles.ROOFING: Grass thatch or iron sheets supported by timber purlins (generally poles) which run over the gable walls. Truss construction is also used. This building is not typically constructed incrementally and is designed for its final constructed size.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction issues:</strong> The building is not built to resist seismic forces and so is not specifically strengthened.

<p>
<strong>Typical problems associated with this type of construction:</strong> There is no materials quality control and not even construction inspection. There are no written plans for such buildings. There are no permit application procedures. People can occupy buildings before completion. There is a lot of waste of materials. A lot of pits can be seen which affects the environment as people dig into the soil next to the building.

<p>
<strong>Who typically maintains buildings of this type?</strong> Owner(s)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on maintenance and building condition:</strong> Owner here means that person to move the process of maintenance upon assessing condition of the building. The actual work is done by masons/bricklayers.

<p>
<strong>Unit construction cost:</strong> There are no established/fixed ways of building so that it is difficult to arrive at the unit construction cost.The unit cost is estimated as K1,000.00/m2 (US$2.23/m2).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Labor requirements:</strong> Labour requirements vary considerably from one-man operation to group work. The construction requires a minimum of 3 and 1/2 weeks to complete building the walls for a 6m by 4m plan with internal partitions for a single bricklayers with 3 helpers.

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> In 1973 another earthquake hit Livingstonia measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale. The 1989 Salima earthquake was the worst in Malawi. It is reported that 9 people died and over 50,000 people were left homeless. These types of buildings suffered a lot of damage, including collapse. Geologists forecast more intense earthquakes could occur in Malawi.The 2009 earthquake resulted in 4 people dead, 300 people injured and 2000 households affected.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:</strong> The mud mortar did not provide any resistance and so the line of crack followed the mortar line from ground level to top.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> The practice is generally to build a new building when one shows weaknesses. The only lesson taken into account is that of strengthening weak areas in new construction. These are at truss-wall connection at ground-wall contact.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> Mainly the owner. Architects and engineers are not involved.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> N/A
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 6:</strong> The 2009 Karonga earthquake provided opportunity to do retrofit but could not assess performance since no other earthquake took place thereafter.
