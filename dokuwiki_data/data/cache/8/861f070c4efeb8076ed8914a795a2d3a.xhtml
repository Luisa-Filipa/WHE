<strong>Building Type:</strong> Confined Masonry Building with Concrete blocks, tie-columns and beams
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Iran
</p>

<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in rural areas of Iran. The percentage of this housing type in those regions is almost 10%. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is a typical confined brick masonry housing construction common in rural areas of Iran. This building type is often used as a single-family house. Brick masonry shear walls confined with concrete tie columns and beams provide earthquake resistance in both directions. This building type is expected to have good seismic performance.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 25-60 years
</p>

<p>
<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>In practice as of:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Building Occupancy:</strong> Single dwelling
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical number of stories:</strong> 1
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Flat:</strong> Typically

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Sloped:</strong> Typically
</p>

<p>
<strong>Comments:</strong> These buildings are typically found in flat, sloped and hilly terrain. They do not share common walls with adjacent buildings. T

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> The typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular. To view outside the building, typically a window opening is built in external walls. These windows almost take 40% of the external walls areas. The other wall has one or two doors. The door sizes are typically 90 X 210 (cm). The overall window and door areas are about 25% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 9
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Confined Masonry: Concrete blocks, tie columns and beams
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The vertical load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. Gravity loads sustain by bearing masonry brick walls. The lateral load-resisting system is confined masonry wall system. In both directions of the buildings lateral load-resisting system are provided by masonry brick shear walls which are confined with concrete tie column and beams.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 15-20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 15-20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is up to 20 %. Total wall area/plan area (for each floor) 0.2.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> To view outside the building, typically a window opening is built in external walls. These windows almost take 40% of the external walls areas. The other wall has one or two doors. The door sizes are typically 90 X 210 (cm). The overall window and door areas are about 25% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> This type of construction does not have many modifications.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> The floor/ and roof are considered to be a rigid diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> The floor/ and roof are considered to be a rigid diaphragm.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> The main function of this building typology is single-family house. In a typical building of this type, there are no elevators and 1-2 fire-protected exit staircases. Building of this type can have as the one main entry so the two doors. Buildings of this type in some places are located close together and in other places are scattered When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 5 meters.

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Typically developers build these types of constructions. Process starts with the foundations and then bearing walls. Process continues by adding the concrete tie columns and then tie beams then placing of wood beams and finally putting the finishing on the hole building. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size.

<p>
<strong>Applicable codes or standards:</strong> The first official issue about this type of building was in 1987. The Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Buildings (Standard 2800) addressed this type of construction. Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Building, 1st Edition- 1987 and 2nd Edition-1999 Iranian National Building Code, Part: 8, Reinforced and unreinforced masonry buildings. The year the first code/standard addressing this type of construction issued was 1987. Iranian Code of Practice for Seismic Resistant Design of Building, 1st Edition- 1987 and 2nd Edition-1999.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Process for building code enforcement:</strong> The building department of municipalities approves the design and holds the designer responsible for the projects. For those constructions, which are supported by government&#039;s fund, there is a proper control during construction. But for the others, there is not any control.
