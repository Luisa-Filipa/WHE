<strong>Building Type:</strong> Precast reinforced concrete frame building with cruciform and linear-beam elements (Series 106)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan). This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Precast reinforced concrete frame buildings (series 106) were introduced in Kyrgyzstan around 1975. This type of apartment building is usually 9-stories high; less frequently, they may be 12 stories. The fundamental period of vibrations is typically in the range from 0.65-0.85 sec. Series 106 was developed by the Kyrgyz Design Institute for construction in seismically-prone areas. Several buildings of this type (about 15 in total) were built in the capital city Bishkek (design seismicity 8 on the MSK scale). The load-bearing structure consists of a precast reinforced concrete space frame and precast floor slabs. Partition walls are constructed using clay brick masonry units or small concrete blocks. Buildings of this type have not yet been subjected to major earthquakes. These buildings are not considered to be highly vulnerable to earthquake effects, provided that the construction quality, particularly with reference to the joints, is satisfactory. It should be noted that precast frame buildings of a different type (Series 111) performed very poorly in the 1988 Spitak (Armenia) earthquake.

<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular form with some modifications at the perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 18
</p>

<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 12
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Moment frame
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The lateral load-resisting system is moment-resisting concrete frame. The load-bearing structure consists of a precast reinforced concrete space frame and precast floor slabs. The space frame (with column spans of 6 m) is constructed using two main modular elements: cruciform element and linear-beam element. The cruciform element consists of the transverse frame joint with half of the adjacent beam and column lengths. The longitudinal frames are constructed by installing the precast beam elements in-between the transverse frame joints. The precast elements are joined by welding of the projected reinforcement bars (dowels) and casting the concrete in-situ. Joints between the cruciform elements are located at the midspan of beams and columns, whereas the longitudinal precast beam-column connections are located close to the columns. The floor structure consists of precast reinforced concrete hollow-core slabs; reinforcement bars are projected from the slabs for achieving the anchorage to the beams. Gravity load-bearing system: The gravity load-bearing structure is moment resisting concrete frame.

<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Not applicable-walls are not a part of load-bearing structure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Walls do not constitute a part of the load-bearing structure in moment-resisting space frame buildings. Typical size of windows is: 1.2m (height) X 1.5-2m (width), doors : 2m (height) X 0.9-1m (width). The overall area of window openings accounts for 30 to 40% of facade walls, while doors account for less than 10% of partition wall area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Usually, modifications are made in non-structural (exterior and interior) walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Buildings of this type have basement floor; frames at the basement are infilled with concrete block walls. The isolated footings are tied with the reinforced concrete foundation beams, which are acting as the foundation for basement walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Precast hollow core concrete slabs
</p>

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Buildings of this type have not been subjected to the effects of damaging earthquakes. Precast frame buildings that were affected by strong earthquakes in the former Soviet Union (e.g. 1988 Spitak, Armenia earthquake) had linear precast elements (i.e. no cruciform members), and the joints were located in zones of maximum seismic moment. It should be noted that the precast frame buildings affected by the 1988 Spitak earthquake (Series 111) are different from precast frame buildings (series 106) described in this contribution. The main difference is in the cruciform elements, larger joint areas, and location of critical joints away from the highly stressed areas of beams and columns-these are all positive features of the Series 106 described in this contribution (see also Table 5.2).

<strong>Additional comments section 5:</strong> This is a moment-resisting frame structure. The fundamental vibration period is relatively low, on the order of 0.65-0.85 sec (considering that there are no shear walls in buildings of this type). Structures of this type are designed for earthquake effects according to the 1981 Building Code and therefore are not expected to be very vulnerable to earthquake effects. This structure is characterized with special construction details for precast frames; such details are not present in other precast frame systems found in the Post Soviet Union, like precast frame of Series 111 which performed very poorly in the 1988 Spitak, Armenia earthquake. Important construction details characteristic of this construction type are: 1. A larger size of cast in-situ joint (approximately 50 cm long). In this way, installation of the reinforcement bars, welding, and casting of concrete is largely facilitated as compared with similar systems (characterized with smaller joint sizes). This is particularly important if non-plastic (i.e. less workable) concrete mixture is used (which is a common case). However, the quality of in-situ construction is considered to be generally poor. 2. Cruciform member joints are located in the low-stressed portions of the beams and columns (away from the beam-column joints) - at the beam midspan and at the column midheight. Beams spanning in the longitudinal direction are loaded only due to lateral load actions, e.g. winds or earthquakes; joints in these beams are located near the columns, in the highly stressed beam zones.
