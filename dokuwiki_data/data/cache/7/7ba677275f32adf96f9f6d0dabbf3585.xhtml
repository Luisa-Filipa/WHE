<p>
<strong>Building Type:</strong> Steel frame buildings with shear walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Chile
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Elias Arze L.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in mainly large cities like Santiago, Concepcion, Valdivia, Temuco, Villarrica. Percentage of total area built is below 2 %. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> These buildings are modern steel composite structures ranging from 3 to 24 stories. The buildings have a rigid steel frame with floor diaphragms made of post-tensioned concrete slabs or composite steel decking, with or without a concrete slab covering. Additional lateral force-resisting elements are added to the steel moment-resisting frame to stiffen the structure and enhance the seismic performance. These elements are steel #X# or concentric braces and reinforced concrete shear walls. The seismic performance for these composite structures is very good. Most of these buildings are used as apartments or offices.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 76-100 years
</p>

<p>
<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>In practice as of:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Building Occupancy:</strong> Residential, 50+ units
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical number of stories:</strong> 3 to 5 and 6 to 24
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Flat:</strong> Typically
</p>

<p>
<strong>Terrain-Sloped:</strong> Off
</p>

<p>
<strong>Comments:</strong> This construction type has been used since 1965-70. Some buildings include commercial ground floor too.

<strong>Who is involved with the design process?</strong>  EngineerArchitectOther
</p>

<p>
<strong>Roles of those involved in the design process:</strong>  Developer hires architects, engineers and construction firms. Architects and engineers must visit the job and provide general supervision. They usually must approve construction contracts.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in the design:</strong> Architects have 5 university years and typically over 5 years of experience. Engineers have 6 university years and typically over 5 years of experience. Construction companies are headed by engineers or architects. Experience about 10 years. The same for fab shops. In steel frame buildings, review of design and independent inspection are typical.

<p>
<strong>Is this construction type address by codes/standards?</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Applicable codes or standards</strong> Chilean seismic codes NCh433.Of96 &amp; NCh2369 are mandatory. AISC and ACI codes corrected to meet seismic codes are applied. Code/standard addressing this type of construction was first issued 1957. National building code, material codes and seismic codes/standards: NCh433.Of96, seismic design for buildings; NCh2369.Of01 seismic design of industrial buildings, NCh428.Of57code design for steel structures. Most recent code/standard addressing this construction type was issued: 1957, but now there is a draft to modify that code that partially follows AISC and AISI.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Process for building code enforcement</strong> Design review by peers (may belong to design firm) is normal. Independent inspection is normal in steel framed buildings.

<p>
<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> There were many connections of the type that failed in Northridge, Loma Prieta and Kobe. No damage in any of them. Probable causes: # Chilean Building Code allows maximum drift about 1/2 of USA. # Periods are approximately 0.05N instead of 0.1N (N=floors) # No jumbo W sections are used # Beams and columns are welded to stress relieved plates. A good example of good behavior are the seven 4 story-buildings from Poblacion Republica Popular China, located in Vina del Mar. They are 46 X 10.6 m in plan, have moment resisting frames in both directions and 12 cm reinforced concrete slab. In the longitudinal direction the span is 4.6 cm. The buildings were designed according to NCh428.Of 57 with A42-27ES steel.
</p>

<strong>Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:</strong> No damage in serious earthquakes in 1960 (M9.5) and in 1985 (M7.8)
