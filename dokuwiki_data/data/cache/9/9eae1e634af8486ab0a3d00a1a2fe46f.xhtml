<strong>Building Type:</strong> Reinforced concrete frame buildings without beams (seria KUB)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Duchanbe (Tadjikistan), Nalchik (Russia), and Almaty (Kazachstan). There are some of these buildings in Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan). This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Frame buildings without beams were introduced in the last decade of the Soviet Union (period 1980-1989) in some of the Soviet Republics: Kyrgyzstan,Tadjikistan, Caucasian region of Russia etc. This type of precast construction is known as seria KUB. This type of apartment building is usually 5-9 stories high; in some cases these buildings are 12 stories high. The load-bearing structure consists of precast reinforced concrete columns and slabs. Precast column elements are usually two stories high. Typically, column spans are equal to 6m. Precast slab elements are made of solid concrete without ribs, and the dimensions are: 3m x 3m x 0.16m (length x width x thickness). Most buildings of this type have some kind of lateral load resisting elements, such as: cast-in-situ shear walls, precast shear walls, shear cross braces, etc. All precast structural elements are combined in 3-D moment frame by a special joint system. Partitions are made of brick masonry or small concrete block masonry. This building type is considered to be very earthquake vulnerable. Seismic resistance of buildings of this type depends on the type of column-to-slab joints. Similar structures were damaged in the 1988 Spitak (Armenia) earthquake.

<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Square, solidRectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typical shape of a building plan for this housing type is rectangular or square with some modifications at the perimeter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 24-60
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 18-24
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Precast Concrete: Moment frame
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Gravity load-bearing system consists of reinforced concrete columns and slabs (same elements as in lateral load-resisting system). The lateral load-resisting system consists of reinforced concrete columns and slabs. In addition to this, most buildings of this type have some kind of lateral load resisting elements, such as: cast-in-situ shear walls, precast shear walls, shear cross braces, etc. In case lateral load-resisting elements (shear walls etc.) are not present, lateral load path depends on the ability of slab-column connections to transfer moments. In case of poorly constructed connections this is not possible and in such cases the completeness of lateral load path is questionable. However, properly constructed slab-column joints are capable of transferring moment as shown by several full-scale vibration tests on buldings of this type performed in Kyrgyz Republic. Precast column elements are usually two-storey high. Typically, column spans are equal to 6m. A typical precast column element is shown on Figure 4. Precast slab elements are made of solid concrete without ribs and the dimensions are: 3m x 3m x 0.16m (lengthxwidthxthickness). A typical precast slab element is shown on Figure 3. All precast structural elements are combined in a space frame system by means of special joints. The assembly of precast concrete elements is shown on Figures 2 and 7. Precast concrete floor slabs are lifted from the ground up to the final elevation. Longitudinal steel bars-dowels are projected from the adjacent slabs and subsequently welded. Transverse reinforcement bars are installed in-situ. Gaps in the connections are filled with concrete at the site. Details of the slab-column connection are shown on Figure 6.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Shear walls usually do not exist in buildings of this type.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 0-1%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 0-1%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Walls are not load-bearing structures. If present, shear elements constitute less than 1% of the floor area in a building.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Walls are not the part of load-bearing structure in frame buildings without beams. If lateral load-resisting elements (e.g. shear walls) are present, the overall wall area usually does not exceed 1% of the floor area. These shear elements are solid (without openings), and are usually located between columns inside the building. Typical size of window openings is: 1.2 to1.5 m (height) x2 m (width), doors: 2m (height)x0.9-1m (width). Overall window area constitutes up to 30 or 40% of the exterior wall area. Less than 10% of the partition walls are perforated by door openings.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Usually, modifications are made in non-load-bearing elements e.g. exterior and interior walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete isolated footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Buildings of this type (seria KUB) have not been exposed to a major earthquake as of yet. However, buildings with a similar load-bearing structure (seria 111) experienced severe damage or collapse in the 1988 Spitak (Armenia) earthquake. The main cause was considered to be damage and failure of column-slab joints. The difference between seria KUB and seria 111 is in the floor slab construction. Seria KUB consists of smaller floor panels that are joined together in the erected position (see Figure 2). Floor slabs in seria 111 were large panels cast on the ground and then lifted and erected to the final position. It is expected that these two construction types would experience similar earthquake damage.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong>
</p>
