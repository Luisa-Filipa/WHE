<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this type are common in rural, sub-urban and urban areas and together they represent 62.38% of all construction in Pakistan [1].
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This report provides an overview of brick masonry housing construction, which constitutes 62.38% of the total built environment of Pakistan. Brick masonry construction ranges from typical one-storey houses which are common in rural areas up to three-storey buildings (common in urban areas). Buildings of this type are generally constructed without seeking any formal engineering input. Due to inherent weaknesses in the structural load carrying system and also to the usage of poor quality construction materials, this construction type has performed extremely poorly during recent earthquakes in Pakistan. Due to the lack of specific construction guidelines and the applicable building permit laws to regulate such construction techniques, an overwhelming percentage of existing as well as newer building stock is now under an increased seismic threat.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Unreinforced brick construction gives few planning options because of its limited strength and stability. Buildings must be configured in a careful manner to avoid susceptibility to damage over time. Brick houses are mostly rectangular in shape, with a length typically not exceeding three times the width. The main entrance is located centrally on the exterior wall. Off the main entrance is a foyer that connects to one or more rooms on either side.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 10-15
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 5-3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in mud/lime mortarMasonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in lime/cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The vertical load-resisting system is unreinforced masonry walls. The loads from the roof are transferred to the walls and to the foundations. Generally, there is no proper connection between the walls. No reinforcement or bands are used. The lateral load-resisting system is unreinforced masonry walls. The walls have very low resistance to out-of-plane forces. In most cases, there is no proper connection between the roof and the walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> It may also contain lime/cement mortar.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> There is no typical structural wall density.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Openings on the exterior walls are kept to a minimum number and size, and are located at least 1-1.5 feet away from corners. Ideally, they should be at least 2 feet away from each corner.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Smaller, individual brick buildings in villages are often built with materials taken on credit from local thallas or through loans acquired from relatives, and are therefore open to incremental modification as more funds become available. Additions to the buildings, generally carried out using the same materials, include an additional room or outhouse, a rudimentary boundary wall, or a storage shed. Larger units, like those in the city, can be subjected to additional rooms, horizontally as well as vertically. This depends on the expansion of the family size, or the decision by the homeowner to rent out some space to tenants as an additional source of income.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footingOther Foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> The foundations are brick masonry wall footings laid in cement sand mortar, 1.5 to 2.5 feet deep, and 1.5 to 2.5 feet wide.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> -Structural concrete: Solid slabs (cast-in-place) -Timber: Wood planks or beams that support slate, metal, asbestos-cement or plastic corrugated sheets or tiles
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> -Structural concrete: Solid slabs (cast-in-place) -Timber: Wood planks or beams that support slate, metal, asbestos-cement or plastic corrugated sheets or tiles Single story brick houses generally have a lighter roof made of timber, steel girders, bamboo/straw with a layer of mud, or corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets. For brick masonry buildings with 2 to 3 storeys, reinforced concrete (RC) slabs are commonly used.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> Typical separation distance between buildings: 2-5 meters. Brick construction is widespread throughout cities as well as the larger towns in Pakistan, with the exception of Karachi, where reinforced concrete slab (RCC) frame structures are more dominant. In villages where the population is more economically stable, structures are commonly built with fired brick rather than adobe. In lower income villages adobe is more common, but is more vulnerable to natural forces like wind and precipitation. Majority of these buildings comprise of single storey residential units and are generally distributed in clusters (mohalla). The main function of this building typology is mixed use (both commercial and residential). Unreinforced brick masonry is commonly employed for residential construction, or as storage sheds for animals, fodder, or precious belongings. In a typical family residence, there is a communal/public space marked as the main entrance lobby/foyer, to which other rooms constituting the private spaces are connected. This entrance lobby is commonly used as a socializing/dining space for the family. Inhabitants retreat to the more intimate private space at night. Planning is a bit different in two-storied houses, which are usually built on larger plots. Half of the plot area would be built upon, while the other half is left open as a sehen (courtyard). A main gate on one corner of the exterior wall grants entry to the sehen, from which one or more doors open into the interior spaces. A separate latrine or outhouse may be located in the sehen some distance away from the living space. An outdoor kitchenette may also be present for more efficient ventilation. From the sehen, a staircase (most often a wooden or steel ladder with a steep slope) leads to the upper story, which may have one or two rooms with the same footprint as the ground floor. Figures 3 to 7 show views of various brick masonry buildings. In a typical building of this type, there are no elevators and no fire-protected exit staircases. Though there was some variety, these are general observed characteristics found amongst homes in the region.

Load-bearing walls may also be thinner, around 9 inches, especially if a light roof is employed. Cement sand mortar is commonly used to bond the bricks together. The height of walls varies from around 9 to 12 feet - generally higher in warmer climatic zones with ventilators at the top to ease ventilation, and lower in colder zones to keep the internal heat trapped. For houses that have an additional story, walls must be thicker to support the load of the roof (usually RCC slab) as well as other loads from the upper floor. Perpendicular walls should meet with appropriately joined teething. RCC or steel lintels are common above door and window openings on brick walls.

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in building process:</strong> Professional guilds may exist in larger villages and small towns that provide a somewhat standardized &#039;version&#039; of craftsmen for daily wages.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Brick masonry construction is usually carried out by local masons and laborers who rely on their experience. The foundations are generally constructed using brick masonry with cement sand mortar and are wider than the walls. From plinth level, the walls are constructed either of mud mortar or cement sand mortar. Various types of roofing materials are used and are directly resting on the walls without any connections. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size.

<strong>Additional comments on maintenance and building condition:</strong> Building repairs are periodically carried out on the external surfaces of walls when plaster or mortar cracks and falls off due to weather effects. In severe cases roofs may be heavily damaged, especially those made of lighter materials, and would need to be replaced. Stagnant water is also known to damage building foundations, so proper waterproofing must be applied to the foundation prior to construction. Depending on the quality of the original construction, the level of maintenance varies. If poorly constructed, the level of maintenance is generally very low.

<p>
<strong>Labor requirements:</strong> The construction of a typical housing unit takes approximately 4 to 6 months to complete

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 3:</strong> The structural system is mainly gravity load-bearing brick masonry walls constructed using either sun-dried or fired bricks with mud or cement mortar. Due to the abundance of good quality clay within the plains of Punjab and interior Sindh. It is convenient to use brick as the primary building material. Local labor is quite skilled in the crafting of individual bricks with a variety of sizes available (average size 4.5 x 9“ x 3”) depending on the scale of construction. Manufacturing and transportation costs for towns within Punjab and interior Sindh which are closer to the alluvial plains are much less compared to a more arid urban center like Karachi where brick is seldom used. This prompt supply of cheap building material means that brick is the material of choice for a range of economic classes within these towns. On the one hand there are those who choose to pay for prefabricated molded and fired bricks; and on the other those that cast their own adobe blocks which cost virtually nothing. Brick is also a natural selection for most people as it is a good insulator. In areas where temperatures can often soar above 38-40 degree C with harsh dry gusts of air the interiors of brick homes stay relatively cool and well-ventilated. Bricks trap heat during the daytime and this heat they slowly dissipate at night as temperatures fall. Similarly they also protect against extreme cold in areas where temperatures are lower. Figure 1 shows a brick kiln in Punjab. Once erected brick masonry buildings can be finished off with a number of external treatment options. It is not uncommon in villages or among economically less privileged users to leave the external wall surface unfinished exposing the brick layers and mortar. This may make the joinery susceptible to natural agents like rainfall and wind. Where treatment does happen it could be plaster paint or ornamental tile work. Brick houses are also found in parts of Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) but with less frequency than in Punjab. KPK contains more stone masonry buildings due to the abundance of stone in the mountainous north and north-west. Figure 2 illustrates the spatial distribution of brick masonry buildings in Pakistan.“

<strong>Patterns of occupancy:</strong> The house caters to one family, or two if the house contains another story. This is often the case in urban areas where space is limited and more expensive, and thus shared. Men generally leave the house for work and children for school, so homes are usually occupied by seniors, women and toddlers until mid-afternoon. In the evening, men return home for meals, after which they may go to other part-time jobs in the neighborhood. The house is fully occupied at night when the family goes to sleep. It is common in smaller towns for the brick house to be used for a home-based business or a cottage industry. This means the number of occupants during the day may increase, which leads to problems of adequate ventilation and limited space for interaction or work.

<strong>Number of inhabitants in a typical building of this construction type during the day:</strong> &lt;5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Number of inhabitants in a typical building of this construction type during the evening/night:</strong> 5-10

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on number of inhabitants:</strong> The number of inhabitants in a building depends on the size of the family. As these buildings cater to rural households, the number of family members can be more than 6 - including at least one married couple, an elder grandparent or two, and a few children.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on ownership:</strong> Brick houses are usually owned by the people who build them. Owners may decide to let one or two tenant families move in which provides an additional source of income for the owner. This also helps cover the costs of periodic maintenance and repairs on the house.

<p>
<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> Pakistan, India and Nepal lie on the Indian plate, which is continuously moving northward and sub-ducting under the Eurasian plate, thus triggering earthquakes in the process of forming the Himalayan mountains. Within the Suleiman, Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges, the Northern Areas and Chitral district in NWFP, in Kashmir (including Muzaffarabad, Quetta, Chaman, Sibi, Zhob, Khuzdar, Dalbandin) and the Makran coast (including Gwadar and Pasni in Balochistan), are located in high or very high risk areas. The ciities of Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar are located on the edges of high risk areas. Figure 8 shows the seismic zone map of Pakistan, which was developed after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake [2]. A large number of major earthquakes have hit Pakistan in 20th century including the 1935 Quetta earthquake, the 1945 Makran coast earthquake, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake and the 2005 Kashmir earthquake [3]. Figures 9 and 10 show the damage to masonry houses in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:</strong> Overall damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this type of construction included: Collapse of wall due to out-of-plane and in-plane effects. Collapse of roof due to out-of- plane failure of walls.
