<strong>Building Type:</strong> Large panel buildings with two interior longitudinal walls

<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Almaty - former capital of Kazakhstan and other cities in Kazakhstan. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is a typical urban residential construction commonly found in the southern part of Kazakhstan. Typical buildings of this type are 5- or 9-stories high. This is a prefabricated large panel construction typical for the post-Soviet Union. Large panel buildings with two interior longitudinal walls (as described in this contribution) were developed in Kazakhstan and were specifically designed for the areas of high seismic hazard (intensity 9 and higher per MSK scale). It is considered that this building type (with two interior longitudinal walls) is superior as compared to other large panel building types (usually characterized with one longitudinal wall only) in terms of seismic resistance. The load-bearing system consists of precast reinforced concrete walls and floor panels. All precast members are joined in a box-type structure by means of panel joints. Facade walls are usually made of 2 exterior layers of low-strength lightweight (ceramsite) concrete with good thermal insulation properties and the interior layer of normal-weight concrete. Large panel buildings are generally well-known for their good seismic resistance, which is mainly due to the large rigidity and high degree of redundance. The fundamental period of vibration for a 9-story building of this type is approximately 0.35#0.4 sec. Large panel buildings of a similar construction (with one longitudinal interior wall) existed in Armenia at the time of the 1988 Spitak earthquake and they remained undamaged, whereas other precast construction types (mainly concrete frame construction) had suffered significant damage and/or collapse. Although the buildings of this type have not been exposed to major damaging earthquakes in Kazakhstan as yet, their dynamic performance was evaluated by means of harmonic forced vibration tests simulating earthquake effects. The buildings subjected to these tests did not experience any damage.

<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral Load-Resisting System: Large panel buildings with two interior longitudinal walls (as described in this contribution) were developed in Kazakhstan and were specifically designed for the areas of high seismic hazard (intensity 9 and higher per MSK scale). It is considered that this building type (with two interior longitudinal walls) is superior as compared to other large panel building types (usually characterized with one longitudinal wall only) in terms of seismic resistance. In large panel buildings, seismic resistance in the longitudinal direction is generally worse as compared to the resistance in the transverse direction. Therefore, additional interior longitudinal wall in a building contributes to its improved seismic resistance. The lateral load-resisting structure consists of the system of precast elements: slabs and the longitudinal and cross wall panels. The length of wall panels is equal to room dimension (length/width), and the thickness is equal to 160 mm (interior walls) and 300 mm (exterior walls). Rigidity and load resistance in the longitudinal direction is provided by four walls: 2 exterior and 2 interior walls. All the walls are continuous throughout the building height. Joint system is developed such that all structural elements work together as a box-type system. Vertical wall panel connections are accomplished by means of groove joints, which consist of a continuous void between the panels with lapping horizontal steel and vertical tie-bars. Horizontal joint reinforcement consists of dowels (horizontal panel reinforcement) projected from the panels and the hairpin hooks site-welded to the dowels (the welded length of the lapped bars depends on the bar diameter and steel grade). Vertical tie-bars are designed for tension forces developed at the locations of panel intersections. Details of vertical wall panel connections are shown on Figure 4. Vertical wall connections under construction are shown on Figures 5 and 6 (note hairpin hooks). Figure 7 shows the welded horizontal reinforcement and vertical tie-bars. Several sets of hairpin hooks are provided for each wall panel over a floor height. The number is variable (generally ranging from 2 to 5), depending on the seismic demand at a particular location within a building. In general, vertical panel connections are designed to transfer the forces in 3 orthogonal directions. In order to ensure adequate shear transfer, vertical panel edges are serrated (roughened), as illustrated in Figure 9. Horizontal panel joints are somewhat different from the vertical joints. Either vertical dowels or hairpins are projected from the top and bottom panels at each floor level. The dowels/hairpins are joined by means of welding. Horizontal dowels from the adjacent floor slab panels are also joined together by means of welding. Details of horizontal panel joints are shown on Figure 3. Horizontal wall panel joints under construction are shown on Figures 5 and 8 (note the horizontal dowels projected from the floor panels and hairpins/dowels projected from the wall panels). Both the horizontal and vertical joints are grouted in-situ using concrete (same mix as used in the panel construction). Floor panels are solid 2-way slabs supported by the four wall panels. Gravity Load-Resisting System: Longitudinal and cross walls and floor slabs.

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> Construction of this type was performed by Almaty House-building complex (ADK), and owner was the City administration. The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size. The level of control is very high. First of all, in the factory ADK the control of materials and structural elements was performed, then during the construction the control was performed by designer&#039;s organization along with special expertise organization so called State Control Committee for Architecture and Construction. Finally, before putting these buildings in operation they had been checked by the City Control Committee.

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> There have been no earthquakes with intensity of over 5 in the region since the construction of this type had started in Kazakhstan. Large panel buildings of similar construction existed in Armenia at the time of the 1988 Spitak earthquake (Richter maginute 7.0) and they remained undamaged, whereas the buildings of precast frame construction had suffered significant damages and/or collapse, as illustrated in Figure 12. These buildings were of Seria A1-451 KP-16/1 and were characterized with very similar panel connections, however they had only one loadbearing interior wall in the longitudinal direction (whereas the construction which is the subject of this contribution is characterized with the two longitudinal walls). None of the sixteen buildings of this type that existed in Leninakan at the time of the 1988 earthquake suffered any significant damage, except for the minor cracks in horizontal and vertical wall joints. In contrast, all 19 buildings of precast frame construction (series 111) that existed in the area collapsed in the earthquake. There were two large panel buildings of this type in Spitak and none of them suffered any significant damage (except for minor cracking). It should be noted that both towns, Leninakan (population 250,000) and Spitak (population 25,000) were completely destroyed. Around 25,000 people died in the earthquake and 12,000 were injured. More than 500,000 people were left homeless in the earthquake. For more details on the 1988 earthquake refer to Rzhevsky (1999), Markarian (1999) and EERI (1989).

The total width of door and window openings in a wall is: For brick masonry construction in cement mortar : less than ½ of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For adobe masonry, stone masonry and brick masonry in mud mortar: less than 1/3 of the distance between the adjacent cross walls; For precast concrete wall structures: less than 3/4 of the length of a perimeter wall.

<strong>Additional comments section 5:</strong> The buildings of this construction type are expected to possess high seismic resistance. Although the buildings of this type have not been exposed to damaging earthquakes as yet, their dynamic performance was evaluated by means of harmonic forced vibration tests, using the resonant frequency of the building for the harmonic excitation. These dynamic loads simulated earthquake effects. The tests showed that the buildings did not experience any damage.
