<strong>Building Type:</strong> Single-family brick masonry house
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Ulugbek T. Begaliev, Svetlana Uranova

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Kyrgyzstan. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This housing type represents a very popular single-family housing construction practice followed in Kyrgyzstan in the recent past. Approximately 80% of the buildings of this type, mostly those constructed after 1990, do not comply with the Building Code requirements. These are low-rise (1- to 2-story high) buildings with a complex plan and wall layout. The main load-bearing system consists of brick masonry walls in cement mortar partially confined with reinforced concrete posts and beams; columns are provided only at some wall corners and intersections. Rigid brick masonry walls have low load-carrying capacity. Wall thickness is either 380 mm or 510 mm. SNiP (Building Code) includes provisions for the horizontal wall reinforcement (welded wire mesh at the wall corners) and the provision of reinforced concrete columns at the wall corners. The floor system consists of precast reinforced concrete hollow-core slabs with typical slab panel dimensions of 5.86 m length x 1.2 m width. Reinforced concrete bond beam (belt) is constructed at the building perimeter at the floor level to provide the confinement and diaphragm action for seismic load effects. Complex building geometry and irregular wall distribution results in significant torsional effects during earthquakes due to the eccentricity between the centre of mass and centre of stiffness. These buildings are located in regions of high seismic hazard, which have experienced earthquakes of intensity VIII, IX or higher (per the MSK scale) in the past. This type of construction is expected to demonstrate poor seismic performance due to poor quality of masonry walls and the complex layout resulting in torsional effects.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Irregular plan shape
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Building plan for this housing type usually has complex plan and geometry.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 15
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 15
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Confined Masonry: Concrete blocks, tie columns and beams
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The main lateral load-resisting system generally consists of brick masonry walls in cement mortar and reinforced concrete posts and beams provided at some locations. According to SNiP (Building Code) it is required to provide columns at the wall ends; column reinforcement is illustrated in Figure 6. SNiP requirements also include the provision of horizontal reinforcement (wire mesh) in mortar bedding joints at each 7th layer. Rigid brick masonry walls have low load-carrying capacity. Poor quality of brick masonry results in low earthquake resistance of the walls even when reinforced with welded wire mesh and steel reinforcement bars. Wall thickness is either 380 mm or 510 mm. The floor system consists of precast reinforced concrete hollow-core slabs with typical slab panel dimensions of 5.86m length x 1.2m width (see Figure 2). Reinforced concrete bond beam (belt) is constructed at the building perimeter at the floor level to provide confinement and diaphragm action for seismic load effects; belt reinforcement details are presented in Figure 5. Roof structures are made of wood or steel. Gravity load-bearing system: Gravity load-bearing structure consists of brick masonry walls, few reinforced concrete columns and beams, and floor concrete panels.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 10-15%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Total wall density is 10% - 15% in each direction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> It is impossible to indicate the typical size of openings since it depends on the architectural requirements. Window size is around 1.2m x 1.5m and doors size is approximately 0.9m x 1.9m. Window and door areas constitute 10 to 15% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Buildings of this type are usually of recent construction and no modifications have been observed so far. However, some buildings have been modified by providing additional doors and windows, expanding the building size (adding new rooms) or by moving the walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> Many buildings have precast concrete strip footing made up of concrete blocks.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Precast hollow core slab system is most commonly used.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Precast hollow core slab system is most commonly used.
