<strong>Building Type:</strong> Adobe / Earthen House : Mud walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Honduras
</p>

<p>
<strong>Author(s):</strong> Matthew A. French
</p>

<strong>Last Updated:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in western, central and southern Honduras. Due to climatic conditions adobe is seldom used in the &#039;mosquito region&#039; on the northern and eastern coast. As with other countries in the region, adobe is not used extensively in the urban centres. Red fired brick is commonly used today. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Adobe is commonly used in Honduras predominantly in rural areas in the western regions. The performance of adobe buildings in seismic events has been very poor, but for many rural poor in Honduras, there is no other option but to use this construction method. The building has a simple plan with three rooms of equal size. The roof is sawn timber with clay tiles.

<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> 76-100 years

<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> Yes

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Square, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> The building is well configured. The rooms are square and symmetrically arranged around the central axis. The main house is composed of three rooms, one central living space and two bedrooms off either side of this.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 4-6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 3-4
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.0-2.7
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Mud walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The 300 mm thick adobe walls act as shear walls in both longitudinal and transverse directions. The stone retaining wall at the rear acts in shear in the longitudinal direction. The roof is a flexible diaphragm, supported directly on the walls. Gravity load-bearing system: The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls. The adobe walls act as the gravity load-bearing structure as well. The sawn timber roof rafters transfer loads to the sawn timber top plate. This in turn transfers to the walls, which take the load to the ground through compression.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> Wall density is unknown.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> There are two small windows on the front elevation and an external door. Internally, there are three doors all opening from the central living space. In the cooking area to the rear of the house, the walls are not full height, and hence high openings are present there as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> This case study demonstrates the way adobe is added to over time as the needs of the occupants grow. The rear of the house now contains a covered cooking area, formed by a large stone retaining wall and clay tile roof. This was added after the initial adobe hose was constructed. There is a wash area at the front of the dwelling, constructed from concrete block which was added at a later date. The timing of additions are predominantly financially dictated.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Rubble stone, fieldstone isolated footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> The site is cleared. The mud brick ingredients (sand, clay and straw) are mixed and placed in a wet timber mould. This mix is compacted and turned out to dry. After four weeks, and several rotations of the drying block, the block is ready for final placement within the wall. While the blocks are drying, the site is further prepared. The wall is constructed by simply laying one block on another with mud mortar between each course until the desired height is reached. The timber roof framing is laid and the clay tiles applied. In this case study, as mentioned, the cooking and store area at the back were added after initial construction of the adobe house. The wall was constructed from locally available stones and cement mortar. The roof was added to connect up to the existing gutter. The wash area was added later. Here, it was necessary to use concrete block as adobe performs poorly under exposure to water and moisture. The construction of this type of housing takes place incrementally over time. Typically, the building is originally not designed for its final constructed size. Typically an initial &#039;base house&#039; is built and as the family grows or finances permit, additions take place.

<strong>Labor requirements:</strong> Typically, adobe dwellings take between 1-3 months to construct. The bricks alone must be left for 3-4 weeks to dry in the sun. As there are many people on site - family, friends &amp; community helpers - adobe is a relatively quick and informal construction method.

<p>
<strong>Vertical irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> No irregularities
</p>

<p>
<strong>Horizontal irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> No irregularities
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in walls:</strong> The adobe walls have little tension resistance under seismic loads. The lintels above the doors and windows are not adequately connected back to the walls resulting in exit points being blocked by their fall, and leading to progressive roof collapse.

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in roof and floors:</strong> The roof is poorly connected to the walls and these poor connections suggest that the roof cannot be counted on to act as a rigid diaphragm, but does act as a timber bond beam.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> The bamboo strengthening scheme is not used in Honduras, but is presented in this report as an option for making Honduran buildings safer.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> Bamboo: Yes, it has been implemented in Peru with successful structural results but unsuccessful local adoption of the concept. Timber ring beam: These are common now but often limited finances ensure they are out of reach for many in Honduras. &#039;Improved Adobe&#039;: Some of the principles, such as small openings and walls, are used but others such as buttresses are not evident.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> No mitigation effort was undertaken in Honduras.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The bamboo system was not constructed in the same manner as new construction, with technical assistance by academics and students used in their implementation. Timber ring beams are often used in new construction by owners.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong>
