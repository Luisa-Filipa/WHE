<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in the Emila-Romagna region and in the south of the Padania Plain. It is widespread in the Reggio Emila Province. The total number of this building type in the Reggio Emilia municipality is less than 9,000. The percentage The percentage of this housing type as a fraction of the entire housing stock in the Reggio Emilia Municipality is approximately 20%. This type of housing construction is commonly found in rural areas.

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is a single family farmhouse construction, found throughout the Padania Plain (Reggio Emilia Province). This housing type accounts for approximately 20% of the entire housing stock in the Reggio Emilia Municipality. This building practice is no longer followed. Most of the existing buildings were built in the 19th and 20th century. The residential and agricultural sections of the house are separated by a central area closed at one end and hence called a “dead door”. The residential section usually has two floors (typical story height 2.5-3.0 m), and a sloping roof. The agricultural portion, usually larger than the residential section, also has two floor levels. The first floor height is on the order of 2.5-3.0 m whereas the second story floor height ranges from 5.0 to 9.0m. As a result, roof in the agricultural part of the building is at the higher level as compared to the residential part. The first floor is used as a cowshed and the second as a hayloft. The loadbearing structure consists of brick masonry walls in lime mortar. The walls are characterized with variable thickness, decreasing from 280 mm at the first floor level to 150 mm at the second floor level. There are brick masonry columns in the interior of the agricultural portion at the second floor level. The buttresses can be found in the exterior brick masonry walls. Both the residential and agricultural sections have wooden floors; there are vaulted floors in the central area. In some cases, composite floors made of steel beams and perforated bricks can be found. Although the building plan is very regular, the seismic performance of this building type is rather poor due to the vertical irregularity (offset of the floors in the residential and agricultural sections), the absence of connections between walls and betweens walls and floors, the thrusting of the roof, and the deterioration of materials.

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, with an opening in plan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 14
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 3
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in mud/lime mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The load bearing structure consists of brick masonry walls in lime mortar. The walls are characterized with a variable thickness, decreasing from 280 mm at the first floor to 150 mm at the second floor level. Brick masonry columns (560 mm depth) are present in the interior at the second floor level in the agricultural portion, and the buttresses can be found in the exterior walls. Both the residential and agricultural sections have wooden floors, while the vaults are present in the central area. In some cases, composite floors made of steel beams and perforated bricks can be found. On the second floor of the agricultural portion, diagonal bracing is present
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Type 7 with lime mortar instead of mud mortar. Brick dimension typically 28 x14 x 6 cm. Lime mortar 1-2 cm thick. Some mortar deterioration, at times due to water infiltration, can be found. Typical Story Height: 2.5-3.0 m in the residential portion and in the first floor of the agricultural portion. 5.0-9.0 m in the second level of the agricultural portion.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 4-5%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is up to 5 %. 5% - 7% at first level, 3% - 4.5% at second level.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> In the residential portion a typical window size is 90 x120 cm. Windows are vertically aligned. At the first floor level in the agricultural portion, small windows are often densely distributed. Windows at the second floor level are used more for ventilation than for light in the hayloft. In the central part of the building there is a large door opening. Estimate of the overall window and door areas as a fraction of the overall wall surface area are: residential portion 25%, agricultural portion 15%, central portion 25%, overall 20%.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> No significant structural modification can be observed in this housing type. Bathrooms have been recently added.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Wall or column embedded in soil, without footing
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> In buildings close to rivers, fieldstone strip footing can be found.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Shallow-arched masonry floor
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Wooden or steel beams with perforated bricks. Floors and roof are considered to be a flexible diaphragm.

<p>
<strong>Horizontal irregularities typically found in this construction type:</strong> Other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Seismic deficiency in walls:</strong> Absence of connections and/or iron ties able to prevent the out-of-plane wall overturning. At the second level, masonry wall is very slender with mortar often deteriorated. Earthquake Damage Patterns: Separation of orthogonal walls, out of plane overturning, shear cracks, corner diagonal cracks due to the roof thrust.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Earthquake-resilient features in walls:</strong> Regular layout and solid bricks.
</p>
