<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in all parts of Romania, and is particularly common in the capitalBucharest. This construction can be found in six quarters (districts) of Bucharest: Militari, Colentina, Drumul Taberii,Pantelimon, Berceni, Iancului, with the total of 8,000 apartment units. Except Iancului, other quarters are located inthe suburban area of the city and consist mainly of newer settlements (built after the World War II). Concrete shearwall construction is commonly used for the urban residential construction and it accounts for over 60% of the newbuildings. There are four different types of shear wall construction which were affected by the 1977 earthquake - type“OD” described in this contribution is one of them. This type of housing construction is commonly found in urbanareas.

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This is typical urban multi-family housing practiced throughout Romania in the period from1965 to 1989. There are many existing buildings of this type at the present time, with about8,000 apartments in Bucharest alone. Concrete shear wall construction is commonly used for the residential construction and it accounts for over 60% of new housing. Buildings of thistype are typically 10 or 11 stories high. The main load-bearing structure is a cast in-situconcrete shear wall structure supported by RC solid slabs. Each building block consists ofseveral (5-6) identical building units (“tronsons” in Romanian) separated by means of seismicjoints. The walls are continuous throughout the building height and orientated in twodirections, with only one centrally located wall in the longitudinal direction and eight walls inthe transverse direction. In addition, there are some lightweight concrete partition walls. Thisbuilding plan is known as the honeycomb (“fagure”) plan. The buildings are often supportedby mat foundations due to soft (alluvial) soil conditions. Many buildings of this type weredesigned according to the 1963 Romanian Building Code (P13-1963) which was updated in1970 (P13-1970). The 1963 Code considered a magnitude 7 design earthquake for theBucharest area. This region is well known as a seismically prone area, with the epicentre ofdamaging earthquakes close to Vrancea. Earthquakes with the Richter magnitude of over 7.0occur once in 30 years. Bucharest, the capital, is located around 150 km south of the epicentreand lies in the main direction of the propagation of seismic waves. The Bucharest area islocated on the banks of the Dmbovita and Colentina river, on non-homogeneous alluvial soildeposits. During the earthquake of 4 March 1977 (Richter magnitude 7.2), over 30 buildingscollapsed in Bucharest, killing 1,424 people. The buildings of “OD” type suffered damages ofvarious extent in the 1977 earthquake, and one building unit (“tronson”) totally collapsed(that was the only shear wall building that collapsed in t

<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Rectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Buildings of this type are of rectangular shape, with a very large length/width aspect ratio (of over 10).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 137.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 11.5
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Structural Concrete: Structural Wall: Moment frame with in-situ shear walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> This building type is characterized with a so-called“honeycomb” (“fagure” in Romanian) building plan characteristic for the Romanian housing design. It consists ofbox-type units creating rooms. Due to such building configuration, the walls are well connected and are able to carrythe loads in a uniform manner. The walls are supported by 120 mm reinforced concrete solid slabs clamped in thewalls and elastically supported by the facade beams. These buildings are typically supported by mat foundations. The lateral load-resisting system is reinforced concrete structural walls (with frame). The main lateral load-resistingstructure consists of reinforced concrete shear walls supported by RC slabs. The walls are continuous throughout thebuilding height and laid in two directions, with only one centrally located wall in the longitudinal direction and eightwalls in the transverse direction (four are continuous over the building width, and other four are of smaller length).The transverse shear walls end on facade with “bulbs”- boundary elements. Wall thickness is on the order of 140 mm.Walls are rather lightly reinforced, with one layer of 12 mm diameter vertical bars and 8 mm horizontal bars. Thereinforcement spacing varies from 150 mm (longitudinal direction) to 250 mm (transverse direction) on centre. Thereare light concrete partition walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 2-3%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 4-5%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is up to 5%. (1.4% - 4.8%) 1.4% in the longitudinal direction and 4.8% in the transverse direction.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> One window and door opening per room, in some cases with a door leading to balcony/loggia. The totalwindow area is about 25% of the overall wall area, and the total door area is even smaller. The walls with windows aregenerally not load-bearing structures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> No modifications were observed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Mat foundation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> The Bucharest area is located on non-homogeneous alluvial soil deposits. The buildings usually rest on matfoundations.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Other floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Structural concrete: solid slabs (cast-in-place, precast)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Structural concrete: solid slabs (cast-in-place, precast)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> Whenseparated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 0.07 meters. Typical Plan Dimensions: Length of a building unit (tronson) = 27.5 m; length of entire building (with 5tronsons) = 137.5 m Typical Span: Spans are variable in the range from 2.2 m to 4.6 m (based on the availableinformation).Each buildingconsists of several (5-6) identical building units (tronsons in Romanian) of rectangular shape separated by means ofseismic joints. “OD” in Romanian stands for Double Orientation (“Orientare Dubla”) - meaning that the largerapartments have light from two sides (i.e. in the morning and in the afternoon) in different rooms. This building typeis characterized with a so-called “honeycomb” (“fagure” in Romanian) building plan typical for the Romanian housingdesign. It consists of smaller box-type units creating rooms. In this system, there are no corridors, and the rooms areconnected only by means of openings (doors and windows). This construction is characterized with large cantileveredbalconies.

<strong>Damage patterns observed in past earthquakes for this construction type:</strong> This region is well known as a seismically prone area, with the epicenter of damaging earthquakes close to Vrancea.Earthquakes with the Richter magnitude of over 7.0 occur once in 30 years. Bucharest, the capital, is located around 150km south of the epicenter and lies in the main direction of the propagation of seismic waves. The Bucharest area islocated on the banks of the Dmbovita and Colentina river, on non-homogeneous alluvial soil deposits. During theearthquake of 4 March 1977 (Richter magnitude 7.2), over 30 buildings collapsed in Bucharest, killing 1,424 people. Itshould be noted that the buildings of “OD” type suffered damages of various extent in the 1977 earthquake, and onebuilding unit (“tronson”) totally collapsed (that was the only shear wall building that collapsed in the earthquake).Buildings with their longitudinal direction aligned parallel with the direction of seismic waves (mainly in Berceni andDrumul Taberii areas of Bucharest) were most affected. The damage patterns were the strongest on the OD16 site.The earthquake action in 1977 was mainly in NNE-SSV direction. Out of 167 building units (“tronsons”) of the “OD”type existing in Bucharest at the time of the 1977 earthquake, only 7 were lightly damaged; the remaining buildingunits suffered a partial collapse (7 units) or were damaged (19 significantly damaged, 72 moderately damaged, 61 lightlydamaged) Balan (1982), Argent (1998). According to the reports, damages to this construction type were due toinadequate wall density in the longitudinal direction, inadequate amount and detailing of wall reinforcement, lack oflateral confinement in the walls and in the boundary elements (“bulbs”) causing brittle concrete failure and buckling ofreinforcement. In addition, quality of concrete construction was found to be rather poor. No damages to the buildingsof this type were observed in the 1986 and 1990 earthquakes. In the 1977 earthquake (M 7.2), no significant damageswere observed on other buildings of similar construction.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on earthquake damage patterns:</strong> ShearWalls - Damage was more pronounced in the longitudinal wall(vertical and inclined cracks); - Cracking in the transversewalls was more pronounced at the lower levels whereextensive “X” cracks developed in the piers between thedoor openings); - Brittle failure of wall end zones withspalling and bursting of the concrete at the base andbuckling of reinforcement bars; - see Figures 15 and 16“Bulbs” - Brittle failure with concrete spalling and crushing at thebase and buckling of the reinforcement (OD16 building) -Crushing of concrete and reinforcement buckling at the firstfloor level (OD1 example) - see Figure 17 Lintels- Extensive cracking

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> The above described methods are used for seismic retrofit of RC structures in Romania. These methods were used forretrofitting the buildings OD16 and OD1 damaged in the 1977 earthquake.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> Seismic strengthening was performed in the design practice after the 1977 earthquake. Many buildings in Bucharestwere damaged in the 1977 earthquake, however the strengthening was not performed in most cases. For that reason,in 1999-2000 the Ministry for Public Works (MLPA) established a special committee to evaluate seismic resistance andpossible retrofit requirements for this construction type according to the P100-1992 Code (latest edition issued in1996). The scale of work and financial resources required for the retrofit are quite significant. As a result, the progress israther slow and in case of an earthquake a significant life and property loss could be expected.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> The work was done as a repair following earthquake damage.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> Yes, the construction was inspected through “The State Inspection for Construction Works”.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> The construction was performed by a specialized state agency.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> The strengthening was performed after the 1977 earthquake. The 1986 and 1990 earthquakes were not very strong anddid not cause damages to the strengthened buildings.
