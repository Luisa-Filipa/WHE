<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in Colombia. It represents approximately 50% of the existing housing stock of medium rise buildings (4- to 6-story high). This type of housing construction is commonly found in urban areas. Majority of buildings of this type found in rural areas are 1- and 2-story high.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Typical multi-family housing construction found in urban areas of Colombia. It is a modern construction practice and represents approximately 50% of the housing stock for medium-rise (4- to 6-story high) buildings constructed in the last 25 years. This type of construction generally predates seismic codes, however some buildings of this type were constructed after the first edition of the Colombian Seismic Code was issued in 1984. This type of construction can be found either on flat or on sloped terrain; vertical stiffness irregularity in the sloped terrain conditions may introduce additional unfavorable effects. Due to poor construction practices and poor detailing of reinforcement, this construction is considered to be very vulnerable to earthquake effects.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Length of time practiced:</strong> Less than 25 years
</p>

<p>
<strong>Still Practiced:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>In practice as of:</strong>

<p>
<strong>Plan Shape:</strong> Square, solidRectangular, solid
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on plan shape:</strong> Typically, a square plan (4 flats per floor) or a rectangular plan (2 flats per floor).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan length (meters):</strong> 17
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical plan width (meters):</strong> 17
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical story height (meters):</strong> 2.6
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in lime/cement mortarMasonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Concrete block masonry in cement mortar
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> The walls carry both lateral and gravity loads down to the R.C. strip foundation. In poor soil conditions, pile foundations are used because of the great susceptibility to settlement of the bearing walls. It is important to mention that the slabs span normally in one direction so the walls in one direction sustain gravity and lateral loads and the walls in the cross direction carry lateral loads only. This is a bearing wall system, wherein the walls provide stiffness for in-plane lateral loading and stability to resist lateral loads (wind and seismic effects). Floor slabs are either 100 mm thick R.C. slabs or different types of slab and joist floors; in some cases, slabs with concrete joists and tile blocks are used. The roof is normally made from rafters, sheathing roofing felt and asbestos-cement tile or R.C. slab. Floor slab can act as a rigid diaphragm; the same is not true for the wooden roof because a continuous R.C. beam (bond beam) atop the walls is often absent.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> Most buildings of this construction are brick masonry in lime/cement mortar or clay brick/tile masonry, with wooden posts and beams; however, some buildings are concrete block masonry in cement mortar or clay brick masonry, with concrete posts/tie columns and beams.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is 6% to 8.5%.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Information about the openings in a typical median building is summarized below: Number of openings Size (sq m): Doors Windows Facade 5 0 1.80 Opening area/wall area: Between 0.5 and 1.0m from corners Position of opening: Interior 7 2.0 0. Total 30%.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> There are no many modifications in this building type. The most typical modification pattern observed is demolition of interior walls.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Foundation:</strong> Shallow Foundation: Reinforced concrete strip footingDeep Foundation: Reinforced concrete bearing pilesDeep Foundation: Reinforced concrete skin friction piles
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on foundation:</strong> It consists of reinforced concrete end-bearing piles and reinforced concrete skin-friction piles. In some Colombian cities e.g. Bogota, deep foundations are mandatory in a typical case. However, in other cities e.g. Medelin, R.C. strip footings are normally used.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Floor System:</strong> Cast-in-place beamless reinforced concrete floorOther floor system
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on floor system:</strong> Other: Structural concrete cast-in-place flat slabs, precast solid slabs The floor is considered to be a rigid diaphragm that transfers the loads to the wall, although in many instances the floor-to-wall connections are deficient.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Type of Roof System:</strong> Roof system, other
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on roof system:</strong> Other: Timber wood planks or beams that support slate, metal, asbestos-cement or plastic corrugated sheets or tiles; wood planks or beams supporting natural stones slates The roof is considered to be a flexible structure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments section 2:</strong> This type of construction is found on flat terrain (in the coastal areas) and in the continental region (the Andean) on the sloped and occasionally very steep terrain When separated from adjacent buildings, the typical distance from a neighboring building is 10 meters.

<p>
<strong>Roles of those involved in the design process:</strong> Whenever engineered, this construction type is built for speculation purposes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Expertise of those involved in the design process:</strong> Architects and engineers participate in the design of buildings of this type built for inhabitants belonging to the middle economic class. However, architects and engineers are not involved in the informal construction developed in areas inhabited by poorer sections of the society. If engineers and architects are involved in the construction, there is a “resident” (architect or engineer) on the site during the construction. Unfortunately, he/she is concerned mainly with the project cost aspects (rather than with the construction quality). Engineers and architects do not play any role in informal projects developed for poor people.

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> This is a typical construction process: firstly, the terrace is formed, followed by the construction of strip foundation. Subsequently, walls, slabs and roof are built, and the masons are skilled or semi-skilled. No equipment is used except for the simple tools. Normally, buildings of this type are built by a developer (in some cases by the owner). The construction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for its final constructed size. The above statements are true, except for the case of informal construction.

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> Due to the fact that this construction type in general belongs to poor or middle class population, the costs of seismic strengthening is so prohibitive and unaffordable; this is a major reason for a very limited experience in this area. For the above reason, only scarce efforts have been made in the area of seismic strengthening. As illustrated in Figures 24 and 25, an appropriate seismic strengthening technique includes the installation of new end confining members in the selected walls. An alternative seismic strengthening technique that would be appropriate for buildings of this type (using the Fiber Reinforced Polymers) is very expensive.
