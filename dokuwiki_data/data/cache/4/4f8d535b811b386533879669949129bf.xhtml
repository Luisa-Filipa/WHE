<strong>Building Type:</strong> Houses with mud walls and thatch roofs
</p>

<p>
<strong>Country:</strong> Kyrgyzstan
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in all regions of Kyrgyzstan. This type of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This building type is widespread in the rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, and also in some urban areas. It is nonengineered construction. Due to its low cost, it is mainly used by poor people. Various building materials are used for this type of construction e.g. clay and straw for walls, wood for the roof structure, and stone for the foundations. In order to achieve adequate flexibility or plasticity, a small amount of clay is mixed with water. Straw is added to achieve an improved consistency. Small panel boards are used as formwork for casting mud walls. The walls are cast in lifts - a new lift is cast after the previous one has set. Windows and doors have wood lintels. Floors are made out of wood planks. Buildings of this type do not have any earthquake-resistant features and are considered to be highly vulnerable to seismic effects.

<p>
<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Mud walls
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: Lateral load-resisting system for buildings of this type consist of clay walls and wood roof and floor structures. Gravity load-bearing system: The gravity load-bearing structure consists of the same elements as lateral load-resisting structure..
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> There are several subtypes related to this structural system: adobe block walls, cast-in-place mud walls, and cast-in-place mud walls with timber elements (sinch).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> 5-10%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Typical size of windows: 1.2m (height) X 1-1.2 m (width), doors: 2m (height) X 1m (width). There are 5-6 windows in a building. Overall window and door areas account for around 12-15% of the overall wall surface area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> No
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> There are lots of modifications to buildings of this type. The modifications are more common in urban than in rural areas. Typical modifications include installation of new door openings, deleting the existing window openings and expansion (addition of rooms).
