<strong>Building Type:</strong> Unreinforced Masonry Building : Brick masonry in mud/lime mortar

<p>
<strong>Regions Where Found:</strong> Buildings of this construction type can be found in throughout the Persian Empire, except places near the sea. Thistype of housing construction is commonly found in both rural and urban areas. This building type is more common in old and traditional cities.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> This building structure derives its name from the four earrings that are constructed at the fourcorners of a rectangular building at the spring level of dome roof. This structural system wasdeveloped due to the lack of of wood and stone. It was widely constructed more than three thousand years ago, after the invention of the dome-roof structures in the Old Persian Empire(Ashkanian &amp; Sasanian). The main problem with the dome-roof building was transforming therectangular or polygonal plan of the group of walls into the circular plan at the spring level ofdome roof. They used to construct the first row of dome and then construct another row ontop of previous one with a little offset closer to the center of the dome circle and so on. Thatwas too difficult to construct. This system was invented to resolve this problem. In thissystem, once the walls were constructed, four earrings (shekanj) were built upon four corners ofwalls intersections, and then it was much easier to build a dome over these. It is an idealsystem to resist vertical and gravity loads and transform them into horizontal and shear loads.For lateral loads, domes behave like trusses and distribute the load to the other parts of thestructure creating a perfect load path.

<strong>Type of Structural System:</strong> Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Rubble stone (field stone) in mud/lime mortar or without mortar (usually with timber roof)Masonry: Stone Masonry Walls: Massive stone masonry (in lime/cement mortar)Masonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Mud wallsMasonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Mud walls with horizontal wood elementsMasonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Adobe block wallsMasonry: Earthen/Mud/Adobe/Rammed Earth Walls: Rammed earth/pile constructionMasonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in mud/lime mortarMasonry: Unreinforced Masonry Walls: Brick masonry in mud mortar with vertical posts

<strong>Additional comments on structural system:</strong> Lateral load-resisting system: The vertical load-resisting system is earthen walls. Load bearing walls and dome-roof systemGravity load-bearing system: The lateral load-resisting system is earthen walls. Load bearing walls and dome-roof system.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Gravity load-bearing &amp; lateral load-resisting systems:</strong> 1. Sometimes walls and dome of the buildings constructed with mud mixed with pebbles as well. 2. Nowadays somepeople use cement based mortar as well.

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 1:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Typical wall densities in direction 2:</strong> &gt;20%
</p>

<p>
<strong>Additional comments on typical wall densities:</strong> The typical structural wall density is more than 20 %. (20% to40%.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Wall Openings:</strong> Due toits load bearing system, it does not have many openings. The openings are usually less than 30% of wall area.Sometimes openings are also provided in the roof as well. These are usually around 50 cm in diameter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Is it typical for buildings of this type to have common walls with adjacent buildings?:</strong> Yes
</p>

<p>
<strong>Modifications of buildings:</strong> Because the structural system is the load bearing system, it is possible only to modify some small openings.

<p>
<strong>Construction process and phasing:</strong> It is basically owner built construction where experienced persons, master builders and maybe some local contractors, with help of laborers, built the structure with shovel, hack, float and other old construction equipment. Theconstruction of this type of housing takes place in a single phase. Typically, the building is originally designed for itsfinal constructed size.

<strong>Additional comments section 5:</strong> This type of structure has a continuous load path, like concrete shear walls, with concrete shell at top that connects thewalls. However, present buildings are constructed of extremely weak and brittle materials. Once cracked, the materials startcrumbling.

<strong>Additional comments on seismic strengthening provisions:</strong> Iranian codes stated that they are not suitable for monuments.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Has seismic strengthening described in the above table been performed?</strong> No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the work done as a mitigation effort on an undamaged building or as a repair following earthquake damages?</strong> Both intervention options have been used; they are used for both matters.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Was the construction inspected in the same manner as new construction?</strong> No.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Who performed the construction: a contractor or owner/user? Was an architect or engineer involved?</strong> Owner, local masons without any no academic background in engineering.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What has been the performance of retrofitted buildings of this type in subsequent earthquakes?</strong> N/A
